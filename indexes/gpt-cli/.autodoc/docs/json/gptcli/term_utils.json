  "summary": "The code defines a few classes and functions that are used to create a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with a GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model. The CLI allows users to enter text prompts and receive generated text output from the model. \n\nThe `StreamingMarkdownPrinter` class is used to print generated text to the console in real-time. It takes a `Console` object and a boolean `markdown` flag as input. When the `print` method is called with a string of text, it appends the text to a `current_text` variable and updates the console with the new content. If `markdown` is `True`, the text is formatted as Markdown before being printed. \n\nThe `prompt` function creates a prompt session using the `PromptSession` class from the `prompt_toolkit` library. It takes an optional `multiline` flag that determines whether the prompt should allow multiple lines of input. The function also defines a few key bindings using the `KeyBindings` class from `prompt_toolkit.key_binding`. These bindings allow the user to clear the input buffer, quit the prompt, and rerun the previous command. \n\nThe `parse_args` function takes a string of input and returns a tuple containing the input text and a dictionary of any arguments passed in using the `--arg value` syntax. It uses regular expressions to find and extract any arguments from the input string. \n\nOverall, this code provides the basic functionality for a GPT CLI. Users can enter prompts and receive generated text output, and can use various commands to manipulate the prompt session. The `StreamingMarkdownPrinter` class allows for real-time printing of generated text, and the `parse_args` function allows for parsing of any arguments passed in with the prompt.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `StreamingMarkdownPrinter` class?\n- The `StreamingMarkdownPrinter` class is used to print markdown or plain text to the console in real-time, with the option to refresh the console after each print.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `prompt` function?\n- The `prompt` function is used to display a command prompt to the user, with support for multi-line input and key bindings for common commands like clear, quit, and rerun.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `parse_args` function?\n- The `parse_args` function is used to extract command line arguments from the user input, returning a tuple containing the input string and a dictionary of parsed arguments."
