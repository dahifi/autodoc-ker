The code defines a few classes and functions that are used to create a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with a GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model. The CLI allows users to enter text prompts and receive generated text output from the model. 

The `StreamingMarkdownPrinter` class is used to print generated text to the console in real-time. It takes a `Console` object and a boolean `markdown` flag as input. When the `print` method is called with a string of text, it appends the text to a `current_text` variable and updates the console with the new content. If `markdown` is `True`, the text is formatted as Markdown before being printed. 

The `prompt` function creates a prompt session using the `PromptSession` class from the `prompt_toolkit` library. It takes an optional `multiline` flag that determines whether the prompt should allow multiple lines of input. The function also defines a few key bindings using the `KeyBindings` class from `prompt_toolkit.key_binding`. These bindings allow the user to clear the input buffer, quit the prompt, and rerun the previous command. 

The `parse_args` function takes a string of input and returns a tuple containing the input text and a dictionary of any arguments passed in using the `--arg value` syntax. It uses regular expressions to find and extract any arguments from the input string. 

Overall, this code provides the basic functionality for a GPT CLI. Users can enter prompts and receive generated text output, and can use various commands to manipulate the prompt session. The `StreamingMarkdownPrinter` class allows for real-time printing of generated text, and the `parse_args` function allows for parsing of any arguments passed in with the prompt.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `StreamingMarkdownPrinter` class?
- The `StreamingMarkdownPrinter` class is used to print markdown or plain text to the console in real-time, with the option to refresh the console after each print.

2. What is the purpose of the `prompt` function?
- The `prompt` function is used to display a command prompt to the user, with support for multi-line input and key bindings for common commands like clear, quit, and rerun.

3. What is the purpose of the `parse_args` function?
- The `parse_args` function is used to extract command line arguments from the user input, returning a tuple containing the input string and a dictionary of parsed arguments.
