The CLI allows users to chat with the GPT-3 model in a conversational manner, either interactively or non-interactively. \n\nThe code imports several modules, including `openai`, `os`, `argparse`, `sys`, and `logging`. It also imports several classes and functions from the `gptcli` package, including `Assistant`, `DEFAULT_ASSISTANTS`, `init_assistant`, `CLIChatListener`, `CLIUserInputProvider`, `CompositeChatListener`, `GptCliConfig`, `read_yaml_config`, `ChatSession`, `execute`, and `simple_response`.\n\nThe `parse_args` function uses the `argparse` module to parse command-line arguments. The function takes a `GptCliConfig` object as input and returns an `argparse.Namespace` object containing the parsed arguments. The function defines several command-line arguments, including the name of the assistant to use, whether to enable markdown formatting, the model to use, the temperature to use, the top_p to use, the log file to use, the log level to use, and whether to run in prompt or execute mode.\n\nThe `validate_args` function checks whether the `--prompt` and `--execute` options are mutually exclusive. If both options are specified, the function prints an error message and exits.\n\nThe `main` function is the entry point of the CLI. The function reads the configuration file `~/.gptrc` and parses the command-line arguments using the `parse_args` function. The function initializes the OpenAI API key, initializes the assistant using the `init_assistant` function, and runs the CLI in interactive or non-interactive mode depending on the command-line arguments.\n\nThe `run_execute` function runs the CLI in non-interactive mode with the `--execute` option. The function logs the start of the session and passes the prompt to the `execute` function, which generates a response from the assistant and executes the resulting shell command.\n\nThe `run_non_interactive` function runs the CLI in non-interactive mode with the `--prompt` option. The function logs the start of the session and passes the prompt to the `simple_response` function, which generates a response from the assistant and prints it to standard output.\n\nThe `CLIChatSession` class is a subclass of `ChatSession` that implements a CLI-specific chat session. The class defines a `listener` attribute that is a `CompositeChatListener` object containing a `CLIChatListener` object. The class also defines an `input_provider` attribute that is a `CLIUserInputProvider` object. The `run_interactive` function runs the CLI in interactive mode by creating a `CLIChatSession` object and calling its `loop` method.\n\nOverall, this code provides a flexible and extensible CLI for interacting with OpenAI's GPT-3 language model. The CLI can be customized using command-line arguments and configuration files, and can be used in interactive or non-interactive mode. The code is well-organized and modular, making it easy to maintain and extend.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of this code?\n    \n    This code is for running a chat session with ChatGPT using a command-line interface.\n\n2. What are the main arguments that can be passed to this script?\n    \n    The main arguments that can be passed to this script include the name of the assistant to use, whether to disable markdown formatting, the model to use for the chat session, and various options for non-interactive and interactive chat sessions.\n\n3. What is the role of the `Assistant` class and how is it initialized?\n    \n    The `Assistant` class is responsible for managing the chat session with ChatGPT. It is initialized using the `init_assistant` function, which takes the command-line arguments and a dictionary of assistant configurations as inputs.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/gpt.md"}}],["1",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/kharvd/gpt-cli/blob/master/gptcli/__init__.py)\n\nThe code provided is a Python script that serves as a command-line interface (CLI) for the GPT-3 language model. The GPT-3 model is a state-of-the-art language model developed by OpenAI that can generate human-like text based on a given prompt. \n\nThe purpose of this CLI is to allow users to interact with the GPT-3 model through their terminal. The script takes user input in the form of a prompt and generates text based on that prompt using the GPT-3 model. The generated text is then printed to the terminal for the user to read.\n\nThe script uses the OpenAI API to access the GPT-3 model. The user must have an API key from OpenAI in order to use this CLI. The API key is stored in a configuration file that is read by the script at runtime.\n\nThe script has several command-line options that allow the user to customize the behavior of the CLI. For example, the user can specify the maximum length of the generated text, the temperature of the model (which controls the randomness of the generated text), and the number of text samples to generate.\n\nHere is an example of how the CLI can be used:\n\n```\n$ python gpt-cli.py --prompt \"Once upon a time, there was a\" --length 100\nOnce upon a time, there was a young boy named Jack. He lived in a small village at the foot of a great mountain range. Jack was a curious boy, always eager to explore the world around him. One day, he decided to climb the mountain to see what lay beyond. As he climbed higher and higher, the air grew colder and the wind grew stronger. But Jack was determined to reach the top. Finally, after many hours of climbing, he reached the summit. And there, before him, lay a vast and beautiful land, stretching out as far as the eye could see.\n```\n\nOverall, this CLI provides a convenient way for users to interact with the GPT-3 model through their terminal. It is a useful tool for generating text for a variety of purposes, such as creative writing, content generation, and chatbot development.\n## Questions: \n 1.

The Assistant class is initialized with a configuration dictionary that specifies the model to use, as well as optional parameters such as temperature and top_p. The class provides methods for generating chat responses based on a list of messages, which can be overridden with custom model parameters if desired.\n\nThe code also defines a set of default assistants, each with a set of default messages and configurations. These can be used as a starting point for creating custom assistants, which can be specified via a command line argument. Custom assistants can also override the default model parameters if desired.\n\nThe `init_assistant` function takes in command line arguments and a dictionary of custom assistants, and returns an instance of the Assistant class with the appropriate configuration. This function can be used to initialize an Assistant object for use in a larger project.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```\n# Initialize an assistant with the default \"dev\" configuration\nassistant = init_assistant(AssistantGlobalArgs(\"dev\"), {})\n\n# Generate a chat response based on a list of messages\nmessages = [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello!\"}]\nresponse = assistant.complete_chat(messages)\nprint(response)\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `Assistant` class and its methods?\n- The `Assistant` class is used to create an AI chatbot assistant that can respond to user messages. Its methods include `init_messages` to initialize the assistant's messages, `supported_overrides` to list the supported model overrides, and `complete_chat` to generate a response to a given set of messages.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `AssistantGlobalArgs` dataclass?\n- The `AssistantGlobalArgs` dataclass is used to store global arguments that can be passed to the `init_assistant` function. These arguments include the name of the assistant, as well as optional model, temperature, and top_p overrides.\n\n3. How does the `init_assistant` function create an instance of the `Assistant` class?\n- The `init_assistant` function creates an instance of the `Assistant` class by first determining whether the requested assistant is a custom assistant or a default assistant. It then creates an instance of the `Assistant` class using the `from_config` method, and overrides the assistant's configuration with any command line arguments provided.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/gptcli/assistant.md"}}],["3",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/kharvd/gpt-cli/blob/master/gptcli/cli.py)\n\nThe `gpt-cli` project is a command-line interface for interacting with OpenAI's GPT-3 language model.

It uses the `PromptSession` class from the `prompt_toolkit` library to prompt the user for input. If the user enters a backslash followed by a new line, the input is treated as a multi-line input. The `_parse_input` method is used to parse any additional arguments that may be included with the user input.\n\nThe `CLIChatListener` class is responsible for handling the chat session. It prints a welcome message when the chat starts and provides options for clearing the conversation or re-running the last message. It also handles errors that may occur during the chat session and prints an appropriate error message.\n\nThe `CLIResponseStreamer` class is responsible for streaming the response from the GPT-3 model to the console. It uses the `StreamingMarkdownPrinter` class to print the response as markdown if the `markdown` flag is set to `True`.\n\nOverall, this code provides the necessary functionality for handling user input and output in the GPT-3 CLI. It allows users to interact with the GPT-3 model through a command-line interface and provides a streamlined way to handle errors and multi-line input. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\n$ python gpt-cli.py\nHi!

When `on_next_token` is called on the composite streamer, it calls `on_next_token` on each of the input streamers. Similarly, when `__enter__` or `__exit__` is called on the composite streamer, it calls the corresponding method on each of the input streamers. This allows multiple streamers to be used together as if they were a single streamer.\n\n`CompositeChatListener` takes a list of `ChatListener` instances as input and combines them into a single listener. When `on_chat_start`, `on_chat_clear`, `on_chat_rerun`, `on_error`, or `on_chat_message` is called on the composite listener, it calls the corresponding method on each of the input listeners. Additionally, when `response_streamer` is called on the composite listener, it returns a composite response streamer that combines the response streamers of each input listener. This allows multiple listeners to be used together as if they were a single listener.\n\nThese classes are likely used in the larger project to allow for modularity and extensibility. By defining composite streamers and listeners, the project can easily combine multiple instances of these classes to create more complex behavior.

The function then creates an instance of `GptCliConfig` using the dictionary as keyword arguments. The function returns the instance of `GptCliConfig`.\n\nThis code is likely used in the larger gpt-cli project to provide a way to configure the behavior of the command-line interface. By defining a configuration class and a function to read a YAML file, the project can allow users to customize the behavior of the CLI without having to modify the source code directly. For example, a user could create a YAML file with their preferred assistant configurations and pass the file path to the `read_yaml_config` function to create an instance of `GptCliConfig` with those values.

The `Assistant` class is not defined in this file, but it is assumed to be part of the larger `gpt-cli` project.\n\nThe `simple_response` function takes an `Assistant` instance, a string `prompt`, and a boolean `stream` as input. It initializes a list of messages with the user's prompt, logs the prompt, and calls the `complete_chat` method of the `Assistant` instance with the message list and the `stream` parameter. The `complete_chat` method returns an iterator that yields responses from the assistant. The function then iterates over the responses and writes them to standard output and a string variable `result`. If the user interrupts the function with a keyboard interrupt, the function exits gracefully. Finally, the function logs the assistant's response.\n\nThe `execute` function is similar to `simple_response`, but it only returns the first response from the assistant and writes it to a temporary file. It then opens the file in the user's default editor (or `nano` if no editor is set), waits for the user to edit and save the file, and reads the contents of the file. If the file is empty, the function prints a message and returns. Otherwise, it executes the contents of the file as a shell command using the user's default shell (or `/bin/bash` if no shell is set), logs the command, and prints a message indicating that the command is being executed.\n\nThese functions are likely used to provide a command-line interface for interacting with the `Assistant` class.

It takes an optional `multiline` flag that determines whether the prompt should allow multiple lines of input. The function also defines a few key bindings using the `KeyBindings` class from `prompt_toolkit.key_binding`. These bindings allow the user to clear the input buffer, quit the prompt, and rerun the previous command. \n\nThe `parse_args` function takes a string of input and returns a tuple containing the input text and a dictionary of any arguments passed in using the `--arg value` syntax.
