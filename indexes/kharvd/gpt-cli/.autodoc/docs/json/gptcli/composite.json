  "summary": "This code defines two classes, `CompositeResponseStreamer` and `CompositeChatListener`, which are used to combine multiple instances of `ResponseStreamer` and `ChatListener`, respectively. \n\n`CompositeResponseStreamer` takes a list of `ResponseStreamer` instances as input and combines them into a single streamer. When `on_next_token` is called on the composite streamer, it calls `on_next_token` on each of the input streamers. Similarly, when `__enter__` or `__exit__` is called on the composite streamer, it calls the corresponding method on each of the input streamers. This allows multiple streamers to be used together as if they were a single streamer.\n\n`CompositeChatListener` takes a list of `ChatListener` instances as input and combines them into a single listener. When `on_chat_start`, `on_chat_clear`, `on_chat_rerun`, `on_error`, or `on_chat_message` is called on the composite listener, it calls the corresponding method on each of the input listeners. Additionally, when `response_streamer` is called on the composite listener, it returns a composite response streamer that combines the response streamers of each input listener. This allows multiple listeners to be used together as if they were a single listener.\n\nThese classes are likely used in the larger project to allow for modularity and extensibility. By defining composite streamers and listeners, the project can easily combine multiple instances of these classes to create more complex behavior. For example, multiple chat listeners could be combined to log chat messages to multiple locations, or multiple response streamers could be combined to send responses to multiple destinations. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nfrom gptcli.session import ConsoleResponseStreamer, ConsoleChatListener\n\n# create two console streamers\nstreamer1 = ConsoleResponseStreamer()\nstreamer2 = ConsoleResponseStreamer()\n\n# create a composite streamer from the two console streamers\ncomposite_streamer = CompositeResponseStreamer([streamer1, streamer2])\n\n# create two console listeners\nlistener1 = ConsoleChatListener()\nlistener2 = ConsoleChatListener()\n\n# create a composite listener from the two console listeners\ncomposite_listener = CompositeChatListener([listener1, listener2])\n\n# use the composite listener and streamer in a chat session\nwith composite_listener.response_streamer() as streamer:\n    streamer.on_next_token(\"Hello\")\n    composite_listener.on_chat_message(Message(\"Hi there!\"))\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `CompositeResponseStreamer` class?\n    \n    The `CompositeResponseStreamer` class is used to combine multiple `ResponseStreamer` objects into a single stream.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `CompositeChatListener` class?\n    \n    The `CompositeChatListener` class is used to combine multiple `ChatListener` objects into a single listener.\n\n3. What is the relationship between the `CompositeResponseStreamer` and `CompositeChatListener` classes?\n    \n    The `CompositeChatListener` class uses the `CompositeResponseStreamer` class to combine the response streams of its constituent `ChatListener` objects."
