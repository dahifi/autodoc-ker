  "summary": "The `gpt-cli` project is a command-line interface for interacting with OpenAI's GPT-3 language model. This particular file contains code for handling user input and output in the CLI. \n\nThe `CLIUserInputProvider` class is responsible for getting user input from the command line. It uses the `PromptSession` class from the `prompt_toolkit` library to prompt the user for input. If the user enters a backslash followed by a new line, the input is treated as a multi-line input. The `_parse_input` method is used to parse any additional arguments that may be included with the user input.\n\nThe `CLIChatListener` class is responsible for handling the chat session. It prints a welcome message when the chat starts and provides options for clearing the conversation or re-running the last message. It also handles errors that may occur during the chat session and prints an appropriate error message.\n\nThe `CLIResponseStreamer` class is responsible for streaming the response from the GPT-3 model to the console. It uses the `StreamingMarkdownPrinter` class to print the response as markdown if the `markdown` flag is set to `True`.\n\nOverall, this code provides the necessary functionality for handling user input and output in the GPT-3 CLI. It allows users to interact with the GPT-3 model through a command-line interface and provides a streamlined way to handle errors and multi-line input. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\n$ python gpt-cli.py\nHi! I'm here to help. Type `q` or Ctrl-D to exit, `c` or Ctrl-C to clear\nthe conversation, `r` or Ctrl-R to re-generate the last response. \nTo enter multi-line mode, enter a backslash `\\` followed by a new line.\nExit the multi-line mode by pressing ESC and then Enter (Meta+Enter).\n\n> Hello, how are you?\nI'm doing well, thank you for asking. How can I assist you today?\n\n> Can you tell me a joke?\nWhy did the tomato turn red? Because it saw the salad dressing!\n\n> c\nCleared the conversation.\n\n> q\nGoodbye!\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   \n   This code is a CLI (Command Line Interface) for interacting with OpenAI's GPT-3 language model. It allows users to enter prompts and receive responses from the model in a terminal window.\n\n2. What dependencies does this code use?\n   \n   This code uses several Python packages: `prompt_toolkit` for handling user input, `openai` for interfacing with the GPT-3 API, `rich` for formatting output, and `typing` for type hints. It also imports several modules from the `gptcli` package.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `CLIResponseStreamer` and `CLIChatListener` classes?\n   \n   The `CLIResponseStreamer` class handles streaming the model's response to the terminal window, while the `CLIChatListener` class handles displaying messages to the user and handling errors that may occur during the conversation. Both classes are used to implement the CLI interface for the GPT-3 model."
