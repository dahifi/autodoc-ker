  "summary": "This code defines classes and configurations for optimization algorithms used in the Twitter Recommendation Algorithm - Heavy Ranker and TwHIN embeddings project. \n\nThe `PiecewiseConstant` class defines a piecewise constant learning rate schedule, where the learning rate is constant within certain boundaries and changes at specified boundaries. The `LinearRampToConstant` class defines a linear ramp-up schedule, where the learning rate increases linearly from zero for a specified number of steps and then remains constant. The `LinearRampToCosine` class defines a schedule where the learning rate increases linearly from zero for a specified number of steps and then decays following a cosine function until it reaches a final learning rate. The `LearningRate` class defines the different types of learning rate schedules that can be used in the optimization algorithms.\n\nThe `OptimizerAlgorithmConfig` class is a base class for optimizer configurations and defines the learning rate as a required parameter. The `AdamConfig`, `SgdConfig`, and `AdagradConfig` classes define the configurations for the Adam, SGD, and Adagrad optimization algorithms, respectively. \n\nThe `OptimizerConfig` class defines the different types of optimization algorithms that can be used and their configurations. It includes the learning rate schedules defined in the `LearningRate` class, as well as the configurations for the different optimization algorithms. \n\nThe `get_optimizer_algorithm_config` function takes an `OptimizerConfig` object and returns the configuration for the selected optimization algorithm. If no optimizer is selected, it raises a `ValueError`.\n\nOverall, this code provides a flexible and modular way to define and configure different optimization algorithms and learning rate schedules for the Twitter Recommendation Algorithm - Heavy Ranker and TwHIN embeddings project. It allows for easy experimentation and tuning of the optimization process to improve the performance of the recommendation algorithm. \n\nExample usage:\n```\n# Define a piecewise constant learning rate schedule\nlr_schedule = PiecewiseConstant(\n    learning_rate_boundaries=[1000, 2000, 3000],\n    learning_rate_values=[1e-3, 5e-4, 1e-4, 5e-5]\n)\n\n# Define an optimizer configuration with Adam algorithm and the above learning rate schedule\noptimizer_config = OptimizerConfig(\n    learning_rate=LearningRate(piecewise_constant=lr_schedule),\n    adam=AdamConfig(lr=1e-3, betas=(0.9, 0.999), eps=1e-7)\n)\n\n# Get the configuration for the selected optimizer algorithm\noptimizer_algorithm_config = get_optimizer_algorithm_config(optimizer_config)\n```",
