  "summary": "This code defines a Dataset class that can be used to read data from a set of Parquet files. The Dataset class is a subclass of torch.utils.data.IterableDataset, which means that it can be used with PyTorch's DataLoader to load data in batches. \n\nThe Dataset class takes a file pattern as input and uses it to find all the Parquet files that match the pattern. It then reads the schema of the first file and validates that the specified columns are present in the schema. The Dataset class can be used to read data in a distributed manner by starting a Flight server that wraps the dataset. The _Reader class is a subclass of pa.flight.FlightServerBase that serves the dataset over a Flight protocol. \n\nThe Dataset class has a method called to_batches that returns an iterator over batches of data. The batch size is specified in the constructor of the Dataset class. The to_batches method creates a pyarrow.dataset.Dataset object from a randomly selected file and calls its to_batches method to get an iterator over batches of data. If a batch has fewer rows than the specified batch size, it is dropped. \n\nThe Dataset class is designed to be subclassed to implement dataset-specific imputation, negative sampling, or coercion to Batch. The pa_to_batch method is an abstract method that must be implemented by subclasses to convert a pyarrow.RecordBatch object to a DataclassBatch object. \n\nThe get_readers function is used to create a list of readers that can be used to read data in a distributed manner. It takes the number of readers per worker as input and returns a list of pyarrow.RecordBatchStreamReader objects. The readers are created by connecting to Flight servers running on the worker machines. \n\nOverall, this code provides a flexible and extensible way to read data from Parquet files in a distributed manner. It can be used as a building block for more complex machine learning pipelines that require large-scale data processing.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `_Reader` class?\n- The `_Reader` class is a distributed reader flight server that wraps a dataset.\n\n2.
