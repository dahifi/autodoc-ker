This code defines a base class for all configuration classes used in the Twitter Recommendation Algorithm - Heavy Ranker and TwHIN embeddings project. The purpose of this class is to provide some convenient functionality for all derived configuration classes. 

The `BaseConfig` class inherits from `pydantic.BaseModel` and overrides its `Config` class to forbid extra fields when constructing an object. This is done to reduce user error by ensuring that only exact arguments are provided. 

The class also provides a way to group optional fields and enforce that only one of the fields be set. This is done using the `one_of` parameter in the `Field` function. For example, if a subclass has two optional fields `x` and `y` that belong to the same group, the subclass can be defined as follows:

```
class ExampleConfig(BaseConfig):
  x: int = Field(None, one_of="group_1")
  y: int = Field(None, one_of="group_1")
```

This ensures that only one of `x` or `y` can be set. If both are set, a `ValueError` is raised.

The `BaseConfig` class also defines two root validators `_one_of_check` and `_at_most_one_of_check` that validate that all `one_of` and `at_most_one_of` fields appear exactly once and at most once, respectively. These validators use the `_field_data_map` method to create a map of fields with the provided field data.

Finally, the `pretty_print` method is defined to return a human-readable YAML representation of the configuration object. This method can be used for logging purposes.

Overall, this class provides a base for all configuration classes used in the project and ensures that they have consistent behavior with regards to extra fields and optional fields.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `BaseConfig` class?
- The `BaseConfig` class is a base class for all derived config classes and provides functionality to disallow extra fields when constructing an object and enforce that only one of the fields be set.

2. What is the purpose of the `_field_data_map` method?
- The `_field_data_map` method creates a map of fields with provided the field data, specifically for fields that have the `one_of` attribute.

3. What is the purpose of the `pretty_print` method?
- The `pretty_print` method returns a human legible (yaml) representation of the config that is useful for logging.
