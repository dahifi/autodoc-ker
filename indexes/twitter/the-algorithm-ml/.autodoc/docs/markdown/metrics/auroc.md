This code implements AUROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve) metrics using Mann-Whitney U-test for binary classification. The purpose of this code is to evaluate the performance of a binary classification model. The AUROC is a widely used metric for evaluating binary classification models, especially in imbalanced datasets. The AUROC measures the ability of the model to distinguish between positive and negative classes. The higher the AUROC, the better the model's performance.

The `AUROCWithMWU` class is a subclass of `torchmetrics.Metric` and has three methods: `__init__()`, `update()`, and `compute()`. The `__init__()` method initializes the class with two parameters: `label_threshold` and `raise_missing_class`. The `label_threshold` parameter is used to determine the threshold for positive and negative labels. The `raise_missing_class` parameter is used to raise an error if the positive or negative class is missing. The `update()` method updates the current AUROC with the predicted values, ground truth, and weight. The `compute()` method computes and returns the accumulated AUROC.

The `_compute_helper()` function is a helper function that computes the AUROC. It takes in the predicted probabilities, target, weights, max_positive_negative_weighted_sum, min_positive_negative_weighted_sum, and equal_predictions_as_incorrect as input. It sorts the predictions based on the key (score, true_label) and computes the AUROC using the Mann-Whitney U-test.

Overall, this code is an important part of the Twitter's Recommendation Algorithm - Heavy Ranker and TwHIN embeddings project as it provides a way to evaluate the performance of the binary classification model. It can be used to compare different models and select the best one for the task at hand. Here is an example of how to use this code:

```
from Twitter's Recommendation Algorithm - Heavy Ranker and TwHIN embeddings import AUROCWithMWU

auroc = AUROCWithMWU()
auroc.update(predictions, target, weight)
result = auroc.compute()
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code implements AUROC metrics using Mann-Whitney U-test for binary classification.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `_compute_helper` function?
- The inputs of the `_compute_helper` function are `predictions`, `target`, `weights`, `max_positive_negative_weighted_sum`, `min_positive_negative_weighted_sum`, and `equal_predictions_as_incorrect`.
- The output of the `_compute_helper` function is a tensor representing the computed AUROC.

3. What is the purpose of the `update` method in the `AUROCWithMWU` class?
- The `update` method is used to update the current AUROC by appending the `predictions`, `target`, and `weight` inputs to their respective lists.
