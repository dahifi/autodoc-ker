This code defines a class `PqReader` that reads Parquet files locally. The class takes in a path to the Parquet file, the number of rows to read (`num`), the batch size (`batch_size`), and the columns to read (`columns`). The class has three methods: `__iter__`, `_head`, `schema`, `head`, and `distinct`. 

The `__iter__` method reads the Parquet file in batches and yields each batch. The `_head` method returns the first `num` rows of the dataset. The `schema` method prints the schema of the dataset. The `head` method prints the first `num` rows of the dataset. The `distinct` method prints the unique values seen in the specified columns in the first `num` rows of the dataset.

This class can be used to read Parquet files locally and display the schema, the first `num` rows, and the unique values in specified columns. It can be used in the larger project to analyze the data in the Parquet files and develop the recommendation algorithm. 

Here is an example of how to use this class to read a Parquet file and display the first 5 rows:

```
reader = PqReader("path/to/parquet/file", num=5)
reader.head()
```

This will display the first 5 rows of the Parquet file.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a class `PqReader` that reads parquet files and provides methods to display the schema, first `--num` rows, and unique values of specified columns in the first `--num` rows.

2. What dependencies are required to run this code?
- This code requires the `fire`, `pandas`, `pyarrow`, and `tml` packages to be installed.

3. What is the purpose of the `head` and `distinct` methods?
- The `head` method displays the first `--num` rows of the dataset, while the `distinct` method displays the unique values seen in specified columns in the first `--num` rows. These methods are useful for getting an approximate vocabulary for certain columns.
