[["0",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/emcf/engshell/blob/master/engshell.py)\n\nThis code is a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with OpenAI's GPT-3 language model. The CLI is called \"engshell\" and allows users to enter commands and receive responses from the GPT-3 model. \n\nThe code imports several modules, including the OpenAI API, colorama, and subprocess. It also imports two files, \"prompts.py\" and \"keys.py\", which likely contain additional code and API keys. \n\nThe code defines several functions for printing messages to the console, cleaning up code and installation strings, summarizing text, and containerizing code. The main function is \"run_python\", which takes a code string as input, compiles and runs the code, and returns the console output. \n\nThe code also defines a \"LLM\" function, which sends a prompt to the GPT-3 model and returns the response. The function includes logic for handling errors and rate limiting API calls. \n\nThe \"engshell\" CLI is implemented in the main block of code. It takes user input from the console, sends it to the GPT-3 model using the \"LLM\" function, and runs the returned code using the \"run_python\" function. The CLI also includes options for enabling debugging and showing code output. \n\nOverall, this code provides a simple interface for interacting with the GPT-3 model and running Python code from the command line. It could be used as a standalone tool or integrated into a larger project that requires natural language processing or automated code execution.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `engshell` project?\n- The code does not provide information on the purpose of the `engshell` project.\n\n2. What is the function of the `LLM` function?\n- The `LLM` function appears to be the main function of the code, responsible for communicating with the OpenAI API to generate responses based on user input.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `containerize_code` function?\n- The `containerize_code` function appears to be responsible for executing Python code within a container and returning the output. It also replaces the OpenAI API key in the code string with the actual key.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/engshell.md"}}],["1",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/emcf/engshell/blob/master/keys.py)\n\nThe code above sets a constant variable named `OPENAI_KEY` to a string value. This variable is likely used as an authentication key for accessing the OpenAI API within the larger engshell project. \n\nThe OpenAI API provides access to a range of natural language processing tools, including language models and sentiment analysis. By setting the `OPENAI_KEY` variable, the engshell project can authenticate with the OpenAI API and use these tools to analyze and manipulate text data.\n\nHere is an example of how this code might be used within the engshell project:\n\n```python\nimport openai\nfrom engshell import OPENAI_KEY\n\n# Authenticate with the OpenAI API using the engshell key\nopenai.api_key = OPENAI_KEY\n\n# Use the OpenAI API to generate text\nprompt = \"What is the meaning of life?\"\nresponse = openai.Completion.create(\n    engine=\"davinci\",\n    prompt=prompt,\n    max_tokens=50\n)\n\n# Print the generated text\nprint(response.choices[0].text)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `OPENAI_KEY` variable is imported from the `engshell` module and used to authenticate with the OpenAI API. The `openai.Completion.create()` method is then called to generate text based on a given prompt. The generated text is stored in the `response` variable and printed to the console.\n\nOverall, this code plays an important role in enabling the engshell project to leverage the powerful natural language processing tools provided by the OpenAI API.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `OPENAI_KEY` variable?\n   - The `OPENAI_KEY` variable is likely used to store a secret key or API key for accessing OpenAI services.\n2. Is the value of `OPENAI_KEY` secure?\n   - It is not possible to determine if the value of `OPENAI_KEY` is secure without additional context or information about how it is used and stored.\n3. What is the significance of the syntax error at the end of the `OPENAI_KEY` value?\n   - The syntax error at the end of the `OPENAI_KEY` value (`'czxc`) is likely a mistake and should be removed in order for the code to run properly.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/keys.md"}}],["2",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/emcf/engshell/blob/master/prompts.py)\n\nThe code is a part of a larger project called engshell and is used to provide assistance to users in writing Python code to achieve their goals. The code imports the OPENAI_KEY from a separate file called keys and the platform and os modules. It then retrieves the username of the current user, the operating system, and the Python version being used. \n\nThe code defines several constants, including ENDOFTEXT, which is used to mark the end of text in the messages that the code generates. The CODE_SYSTEM_CALIBRATION_MESSAGE constant is a message that is displayed to the user when they need to provide Python code to solve a problem. The DEBUG_SYSTEM_CALIBRATION_MESSAGE constant is a message that is displayed to the user when they need to debug their code. The INSTALL_SYSTEM_CALIBRATION_MESSAGE constant is a message that is displayed to the user when they need to install a package. The INSTALL_USER_MESSAGE function is a lambda function that takes a package name as an argument and returns a message that prompts the user to provide the pip command to install the package. The LLM_SYSTEM_CALIBRATION_MESSAGE constant is a message that is displayed to the user when they need assistance in achieving their goal. The CONGNITIVE_USER_MESSAGE constant is a message that is displayed to the user when they need to use a large language model to help achieve their goal. \n\nThe code also defines several functions, including the USER_MESSAGE function, which takes a goal and the current directory as arguments and returns a message that prompts the user to provide Python code to achieve their goal.
