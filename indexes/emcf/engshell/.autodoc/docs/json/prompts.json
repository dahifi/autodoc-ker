  "summary": "The code is a part of a larger project called engshell and is used to provide assistance to users in writing Python code to achieve their goals. The code imports the OPENAI_KEY from a separate file called keys and the platform and os modules. It then retrieves the username of the current user, the operating system, and the Python version being used. \n\nThe code defines several constants, including ENDOFTEXT, which is used to mark the end of text in the messages that the code generates. The CODE_SYSTEM_CALIBRATION_MESSAGE constant is a message that is displayed to the user when they need to provide Python code to solve a problem. The DEBUG_SYSTEM_CALIBRATION_MESSAGE constant is a message that is displayed to the user when they need to debug their code. The INSTALL_SYSTEM_CALIBRATION_MESSAGE constant is a message that is displayed to the user when they need to install a package. The INSTALL_USER_MESSAGE function is a lambda function that takes a package name as an argument and returns a message that prompts the user to provide the pip command to install the package. The LLM_SYSTEM_CALIBRATION_MESSAGE constant is a message that is displayed to the user when they need assistance in achieving their goal. The CONGNITIVE_USER_MESSAGE constant is a message that is displayed to the user when they need to use a large language model to help achieve their goal. \n\nThe code also defines several functions, including the USER_MESSAGE function, which takes a goal and the current directory as arguments and returns a message that prompts the user to provide Python code to achieve their goal. The DEBUG_MESSAGE function takes the user's code and the error message as arguments and returns a message that prompts the user to explain why the error is happening and to provide corrected code. \n\nThe CODE_USER_CALIBRATION_MESSAGE constant is a message that is displayed to the user when they need to create a PowerPoint presentation about Eddington Luminosity. The CODE_ASSISTANT_CALIBRATION_MESSAGE constant is the Python code that the user needs to run to achieve their goal. The code uses the Wikipedia API to retrieve information about Eddington Luminosity and the pptx module to create a PowerPoint presentation. The code also uses the OpenAI API to generate bullet points for each section of the Wikipedia page. The CODE_USER_CALIBRATION_MESSAGE_UNSPLASH_EXAMPLE constant is a message that is displayed to the user when they need to change their wallpaper to a galaxy. The CODE_ASSISTANT_CALIBRATION_MESSAGE_UNSPLASH_EXAMPLE constant is the Python code that the user needs to run to achieve their goal. The code uses the Unsplash API to retrieve a landscape-oriented image of a galaxy and ctypes to change the wallpaper. \n\nThe CONSOLE_OUTPUT_CALIBRATION_MESSAGE constant is a message that is displayed to the user when their goal has been achieved. The code is designed to be used as a prompt for users to provide Python code to achieve their goals, and it provides assistance in debugging, installing packages, and using large language models to achieve their goals. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\n# Prompt the user to provide Python code to achieve their goal\nprint(USER_MESSAGE(\"Create a function to calculate the factorial of a number\", \"/home/user\"))\n\n# Prompt the user to explain why their code is not working and provide corrected code\nprint(DEBUG_MESSAGE(\"def factorial(n):\\n\\tif n == 0:\\n\\t\\treturn 1\\n\\telse:\\n\\t\\treturn n * factorial(n-1)\", \"RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded\"))\n\n# Display the message to the user to create a PowerPoint presentation about Eddington Luminosity\nprint(CODE_USER_CALIBRATION_MESSAGE)\n\n# Display the Python code that the user needs to run to achieve their goal\nprint(CODE_ASSISTANT_CALIBRATION_MESSAGE)\n\n# Display the message to the user to change their wallpaper to a galaxy\nprint(CODE_USER_CALIBRATION_MESSAGE_UNSPLASH_EXAMPLE)\n\n# Display the Python code that the user needs to run to achieve their goal\nprint(CODE_ASSISTANT_CALIBRATION_MESSAGE_UNSPLASH_EXAMPLE)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `keys` module being imported?\n- The `keys` module is being imported to access the `OPENAI_KEY` variable, which is likely an API key needed for using OpenAI's language model.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `ENDOFTEXT` variable?\n- The `ENDOFTEXT` variable is being used as a delimiter to mark the end of text input for the OpenAI language model.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `CODE_ASSISTANT_CALIBRATION_MESSAGE` variable?\n- The `CODE_ASSISTANT_CALIBRATION_MESSAGE` variable contains code that uses the OpenAI language model to create a PowerPoint presentation about Eddington Luminosity, using information from a Wikipedia page.",
