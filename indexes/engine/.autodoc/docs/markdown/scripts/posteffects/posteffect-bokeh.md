# BokehEffect

The `BokehEffect` class is a post-processing effect that simulates the depth of field effect of a camera lens. It is a subclass of the `PostEffect` class and is used to create a new instance of the post effect. The `BokehEffect` class takes in a `GraphicsDevice` object as a parameter and sets the `needsDepthBuffer` property to `true`.

The `BokehEffect` class uses a depth-of-field shader with bokeh, which is a blur filter that simulates the out-of-focus areas of a photograph. The shader is ported from a GLSL shader by Martins Upitis. The shader takes in a color buffer, a maximum blur amount, an aperture value, a focus value, and an aspect ratio. The shader calculates the factor by which to blur the image based on the depth of the pixel and the focus value. The shader then applies the blur to the image using a series of texture samples.

The `BokehEffect` class has three properties: `maxBlur`, `aperture`, and `focus`. The `maxBlur` property sets the maximum amount of blurring, which ranges from 0 to 1. The `aperture` property sets the size of the aperture, which affects the depth of field. Bigger values create a shallower depth of field. The `focus` property controls the focus of the effect.

The `BokehEffect` class has a `render` method that takes in an input target, an output target, and a rectangle. The method sets the values of the uniforms in the shader and then draws a quad using the shader and the output target.

# Bokeh Script

The `Bokeh` script is a script that adds the `BokehEffect` post-processing effect to a camera. The script has three attributes: `maxBlur`, `aperture`, and `focus`. The attributes are used to set the properties of the `BokehEffect` object.

The `Bokeh` script initializes a new instance of the `BokehEffect` class and sets its properties to the values of the attributes. The script then adds the effect to the camera's post-effects queue. The script also listens for changes to the attributes and updates the effect accordingly. Finally, the script removes the effect from the queue when the script is destroyed.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code implements the BokehEffect post-processing effect in the PlayCanvas engine.

2. What are the properties of the BokehEffect object?
- The BokehEffect object has three properties: maxBlur, aperture, and focus.

3. How is the BokehEffect object used in the PlayCanvas engine?
- The BokehEffect object is used as a post-processing effect in the PlayCanvas engine. It is added to the camera's postEffects queue and applied to the scene during rendering.
