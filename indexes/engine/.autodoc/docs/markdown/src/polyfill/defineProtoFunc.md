The code defines a function called `defineProtoFunc` that is used to polyfill prototype methods that are not iterated in for-in loops. This function takes in three parameters: `cls`, `name`, and `func`. 

The `cls` parameter is an object constructor, `name` is a string representing the name of the prototype method to be polyfilled, and `func` is the function that will be used to polyfill the method. 

The purpose of this function is to add a new method to an object's prototype if it does not already exist. This is done by using the `Object.defineProperty` method to define a new property on the object's prototype with the given `name` and `func`. The `configurable` property is set to `true` to allow the property to be deleted later if needed, and `enumerable` is set to `false` to prevent the property from being included in for-in loops. 

This function is likely used throughout the PlayCanvas engine project to add new methods to object prototypes as needed. For example, if a new method is added to the `pc.Entity` prototype, this function could be used to ensure that the method is available on all `pc.Entity` instances. 

Here is an example of how this function could be used to add a new method to an object's prototype:

```
function MyObject() {
  // constructor code
}

defineProtoFunc(MyObject, 'myMethod', function() {
  // method code
});

var obj = new MyObject();
obj.myMethod(); // calls the polyfilled method
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this function?
    
    This function is a shorthand method to polyfill prototype methods that are not iterated in for-in loops.

2. What are the parameters of this function and what do they represent?
    
    The parameters of this function are `cls`, `name`, and `func`. `cls` represents the object constructor, `name` represents the name of the prototype method, and `func` represents the function to be added to the prototype.

3. What does the `@ignore` tag in the JSDoc comment mean?
    
    The `@ignore` tag in the JSDoc comment indicates that this function should be ignored by the documentation generator.
