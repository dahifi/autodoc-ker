The code defines a class called `XrTrackedImage` which is used to represent a tracked image in an AR (Augmented Reality) system. The class extends the `EventHandler` class which allows it to handle events. The class has several private and public properties and methods that are used to manage the state of the tracked image.

The `XrTrackedImage` class has a constructor that takes two parameters: an image and a width. The image parameter is an HTML element that represents the image being tracked. The width parameter is the width of the image in meters. The constructor sets the `_image` and `_width` properties of the class to the values passed in as parameters.

The class has several private properties that are used to manage the state of the tracked image. These properties include `_bitmap`, `_measuredWidth`, `_trackable`, `_tracking`, `_emulated`, `_pose`, `_position`, and `_rotation`. These properties are used to store information about the tracking state of the image, its position and rotation in the real world, and other related information.

The class has several public properties and methods that can be used to interact with the tracked image. These include the `image`, `width`, `trackable`, `tracking`, and `emulated` properties, and the `getPosition()` and `getRotation()` methods. The `image` property returns the image being tracked, while the `width` property gets or sets the width of the image in meters. The `trackable` property returns a boolean value indicating whether the image is trackable or not. The `tracking` property returns a boolean value indicating whether the image is currently being tracked or not. The `emulated` property returns a boolean value indicating whether the image was recently tracked but is not currently being actively tracked.

The `getPosition()` and `getRotation()` methods return the position and rotation of the tracked image respectively. These methods can be used to update the position and rotation of an entity in the AR system to match the position and rotation of the tracked image.

Overall, the `XrTrackedImage` class is an important part of the PlayCanvas engine's AR system. It provides a way to represent and manage tracked images in an AR system, and allows developers to interact with these images in a meaningful way.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a class called `XrTrackedImage` which represents a tracked image in an AR session. It contains information about the tracking state, position, and rotation of the image.

2. What parameters are required to create an instance of `XrTrackedImage`?
- An instance of `XrTrackedImage` requires an image that matches the real world image as closely as possible and a width (in meters) of the image in the real world.

3. What methods are available to get the position and rotation of a tracked image?
- The `getPosition()` and `getRotation()` methods can be used to get the position and rotation of a tracked image, respectively.
