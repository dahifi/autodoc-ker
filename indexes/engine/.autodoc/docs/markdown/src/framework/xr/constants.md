This file contains a set of constants that define different types of XR sessions, reference spaces, target rays, hand types, trackable types, and depth sensing preferences. These constants are used throughout the PlayCanvas engine to provide a standardized way of referring to these different types.

The XR session types include XRTYPE_INLINE, XRTYPE_VR, and XRTYPE_AR, which represent inline sessions, immersive VR sessions, and immersive AR sessions, respectively. These types are used to specify the type of session that should be created when initializing an XR session.

The reference spaces include XRSPACE_VIEWER, XRSPACE_LOCAL, XRSPACE_LOCALFLOOR, XRSPACE_BOUNDEDFLOOR, and XRSPACE_UNBOUNDED. These represent different types of tracking spaces that can be used in an XR session. For example, XRSPACE_LOCAL represents a tracking space with a native origin near the viewer at the time of creation, while XRSPACE_UNBOUNDED represents a tracking space where the user is expected to move freely around their environment.

The target rays include XRTARGETRAY_GAZE, XRTARGETRAY_SCREEN, and XRTARGETRAY_POINTER, which represent different types of input sources for the XR session. For example, XRTARGETRAY_GAZE indicates that the target ray will originate at the viewer and follow the direction it is facing.

The hand types include XRHAND_NONE, XRHAND_LEFT, and XRHAND_RIGHT, which represent different types of input sources for the XR session. For example, XRHAND_LEFT indicates that the input source is meant to be held in the left hand.

The trackable types include XRTRACKABLE_POINT, XRTRACKABLE_PLANE, and XRTRACKABLE_MESH, which represent different types of objects that can be tracked in an XR session. For example, XRTRACKABLE_PLANE indicates that the hit test results will be computed based on the planes detected by the underlying Augmented Reality system.

Finally, the depth sensing preferences include XRDEPTHSENSINGUSAGE_CPU, XRDEPTHSENSINGUSAGE_GPU, XRDEPTHSENSINGFORMAT_L8A8, and XRDEPTHSENSINGFORMAT_F32, which represent different preferences for how depth sensing should be performed in an XR session. For example, XRDEPTHSENSINGUSAGE_CPU indicates that depth sensing preferred usage is CPU.

Overall, this file provides a standardized set of constants that can be used throughout the PlayCanvas engine to refer to different types of XR sessions, reference spaces, target rays, hand types, trackable types, and depth sensing preferences. This helps to ensure consistency and clarity throughout the codebase.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines constants for different types of XR sessions, reference spaces, target rays, hand types, trackable types, and depth sensing preferences.

2. What are some examples of use cases for these constants?
- These constants can be used in XR-related code to specify the type of session, reference space, target ray, hand type, trackable type, or depth sensing preference that is being used.

3. Are there any limitations or dependencies associated with these constants?
- The code does not provide any information on limitations or dependencies associated with these constants. It is possible that certain constants may only be available on certain platforms or with certain devices, but this is not specified in the code.
