The `CubemapHandler` class is a resource handler used for loading cubemap textures. It implements the `ResourceHandler` interface and is responsible for loading, opening, patching, and updating cubemap assets. 

When a cubemap asset is loaded, the `loadAssets` method is called. This method initializes the asset structures for tracking load requests and retrieves the list of dependent asset ids for the cubemap. The dependent assets include the prefiltered cubemap and the six faces of the cubemap. The method then processes each dependent asset by checking if it is already loaded, registering for load and error events if it is not loaded, or creating a new asset if it is a URL or file object. Once all dependent assets are loaded, the `update` method is called to update the cubemap resources with the newly loaded assets. 

The `update` method first extracts the prelit data from the prefiltered cubemap asset and creates new cubemap resources for each level of the prelit cubemap. It then extracts the cubemap level data from the six face texture assets and creates a new cubemap resource for the faces. The method checks if any of the resources have changed and sets the new resources, firing change events. Finally, the method destroys the old cubemap resources that are no longer needed and unloads the old assets that have been replaced. 

The `CubemapHandler` class is used in the larger PlayCanvas engine project to handle the loading and updating of cubemap textures. It is used by the `AssetRegistry` to manage cubemap assets and by the `SceneLoader` to load cubemap textures for use in scenes. 

Example usage:

```
import { CubemapHandler } from 'playcanvas';

// create a new app
const app = new pc.Application();

// create a new cubemap asset
const cubemapAsset = new pc.Asset('myCubemap', 'cubemap', {
    url: 'path/to/cubemap'
});

// create a new cubemap handler
const cubemapHandler = new CubemapHandler(app);

// load the cubemap asset
cubemapHandler.loadAssets(cubemapAsset, function (err, resources) {
    if (!err) {
        // cubemap resources are now available
        const cubemap = new pc.Texture(app.graphicsDevice, {
            cubemap: true,
            rgbm: true,
            fixCubemapSeams: true,
            ...resources
        });
    }
});

// add the cubemap asset to the asset registry
app.assets.add(cubemapAsset);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file contains the implementation of a resource handler used for loading cubemap textures in the PlayCanvas engine.

2. What dependencies does this code file have?
- This code file imports constants and the Texture class from the graphics module, as well as the Asset class from the asset module. It also depends on the AppBase class and the loader and assets properties of the app instance passed to its constructor.

3. What is the main functionality of the CubemapHandler class?
- The CubemapHandler class is responsible for loading and updating cubemap texture resources. It implements the ResourceHandler interface and provides methods for loading, opening, and patching assets, as well as for getting the list of dependent asset ids and comparing asset ids. It also defines a cmpArrays method for comparing arrays and a resolveId method for converting string ids to integers.
