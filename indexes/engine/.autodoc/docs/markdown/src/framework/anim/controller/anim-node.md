The code defines a class called `AnimNode` which is used to represent a single animation track in the current state. The purpose of this class is to store information about an animation track, such as its name, speed, weight, and coordinate/vector. 

An `AnimNode` can be part of a `BlendTree` hierarchy, which controls the weight (contribution to the state's final animation) of its child `AnimNodes`. The `AnimNode` class has a constructor that takes in several parameters, including the `AnimState` that it belongs to, its parent `BlendTree`, its name, its coordinate/vector, and its speed. 

The `AnimNode` class has several getter and setter methods that allow access to its properties, such as its parent, name, path, point, weight, speed, and animTrack. The `weight` property is calculated based on the weight of its parent and its own weight. The `normalizedWeight` property is calculated based on the total weight of the state that it belongs to. The `speed` property is calculated based on its weighted speed and its speed. 

This class is used in the larger PlayCanvas engine project to store information about animation tracks and their weights in a state. It is also used to calculate the final animation based on the weights of the `AnimNodes` in the `BlendTree` hierarchy. 

Example usage:

```javascript
import { AnimNode } from 'playcanvas';

const state = new AnimState();
const parent = new BlendTree(state);
const name = 'animNode';
const point = [0, 0];
const speed = 1;

const animNode = new AnimNode(state, parent, name, point, speed);
animNode.weight = 0.5;
animNode.weightedSpeed = 0.8;
animNode.animTrack = new AnimTrack();
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Vec2` import from `../../../core/math/vec2.js`?
- The `Vec2` import is used to create a coordinate/vector that determines the weight of the `AnimNode` when it's part of a `BlendTree`.

2. What is the significance of the `speed` parameter in the `constructor` method?
- The `speed` parameter sets the speed that the `AnimTrack` should play at, with a default value of 1.

3. What is the purpose of the `normalizedWeight` getter?
- The `normalizedWeight` getter returns the weight of the `AnimNode` divided by the total weight of the `AnimState`, ensuring that the weights of all `AnimNodes` in the state add up to 1.
