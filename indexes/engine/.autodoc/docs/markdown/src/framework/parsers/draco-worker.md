The `DracoWorker` function is a Web Worker that decodes Draco compressed meshes. It loads the Draco WebAssembly module and provides a `decodeMesh` function that accepts a `DataView` containing the compressed mesh data and returns an object containing the decoded mesh vertices and indices. The `decodeMesh` function uses the Draco decoder to decode the mesh data and generates normals if they are missing. The decoded mesh data is interleaved and packed into an `ArrayBuffer` that is returned as part of the result object.

The `DracoWorker` function uses the following constants and functions:

- `POSITION_ATTRIBUTE` and `NORMAL_ATTRIBUTE` are constants that represent the attribute types for position and normal data.
- `loadWasm` is a function that loads the Draco WebAssembly module and returns a promise that resolves to the module instance.
- `wrap` is a function that wraps a typed array with a new typed array of a different data type.
- `componentSizeInBytes` is a function that returns the size in bytes of a component of a given data type.
- `attributeSizeInBytes` is a function that returns the size in bytes of an attribute.
- `attributeOrder` is an object that maps attribute types to indices used for sorting attributes.
- `generateNormals` is a function that generates normals for a mesh given its vertices and indices.
- `decodeMesh` is a function that decodes a Draco compressed mesh and returns an object containing the decoded mesh vertices and indices.
- `decode` is a function that decodes a mesh data object and posts a message containing the decoded mesh data back to the main thread.

The `DracoWorker` function exports the `DracoWorker` class, which can be used to create a new instance of the worker. The `DracoWorker` class provides a `decodeMesh` method that can be used to decode a compressed mesh. The `decodeMesh` method accepts a `DataView` containing the compressed mesh data and returns a promise that resolves to an object containing the decoded mesh vertices and indices. The `DracoWorker` class uses the `Worker` API to create a new Web Worker and communicate with it using messages.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a worker function called `DracoWorker` that can decode Draco-encoded meshes and generate normals for them.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
- This code depends on the Draco library, which is loaded as a WebAssembly module and a JavaScript file.

3. What is the format of the data that this code can decode?
- This code can decode data that represents a triangular mesh in the Draco format.
