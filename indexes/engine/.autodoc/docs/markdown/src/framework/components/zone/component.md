The `ZoneComponent` class is a component of the PlayCanvas engine that allows developers to define an area in world space of a certain size. This component can be used in various ways, such as affecting audio reverb when an `AudioListenerComponent` is within the zone, or creating a culling system with portals between zones to hide whole indoor sections for performance reasons. Zones are building blocks and meant to be used in many different ways.

This class extends the `Component` class and has several events that can be fired when the component becomes enabled or disabled, changes state, or is removed from an entity. The `size` property of the `ZoneComponent` class is a `Vec3` object that represents the size of the axis-aligned box of the zone.

The `ZoneComponent` class has several methods that are used to check the state of the component and fire events accordingly. The `_checkState()` method checks if the component is enabled and if the entity it is attached to is enabled. If the state of the component has changed, the `enable` and `state` events are fired. The `_onSetEnabled()` method is called when the `enabled` property of the component is set and calls the `_checkState()` method. The `onEnable()` and `onDisable()` methods are called when the component is enabled or disabled, respectively, and call the `_checkState()` method. The `_onBeforeRemove()` method is called when the component is removed from an entity and fires the `remove` event.

Here is an example of how to create a new `ZoneComponent` instance:

```javascript
import { ZoneComponent } from 'path/to/zone/component.js';

const zone = new ZoneComponent(system, entity);
zone.size = [10, 10, 10];
```

In this example, a new `ZoneComponent` instance is created and the `size` property is set to a `Vec3` object with the values `[10, 10, 10]`. This component can now be used to define an area in world space of a certain size and can be used in various ways, such as affecting audio reverb or creating a culling system with portals between zones.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ZoneComponent` in the PlayCanvas engine?
- The `ZoneComponent` allows developers to define an area in world space of a certain size, which can be used for various purposes such as affecting audio reverb or creating a culling system with portals between zones to hide indoor sections for performance reasons.

2. What events can be fired by the `ZoneComponent`?
- The `ZoneComponent` can fire events for when it becomes enabled, disabled, changes state, or is removed from an entity.

3. How does the `size` property of the `ZoneComponent` work?
- The `size` property of the `ZoneComponent` is a `Vec3` object that represents the size of the axis-aligned box of the zone. It can be set either by passing in a `Vec3` object or an array of at least 3 values representing the x, y, and z dimensions.
