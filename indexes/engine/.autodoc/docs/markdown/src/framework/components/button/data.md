The code defines a class called `ButtonComponentData` that represents the data associated with a button component in the PlayCanvas engine. The purpose of this class is to store the various properties and settings that define the behavior and appearance of a button in a PlayCanvas application.

The class imports two other classes from the PlayCanvas engine: `Color` and `Vec4`. `Color` is used to define the various colors associated with the button, such as the hover tint, pressed tint, and inactive tint. `Vec4` is used to define the hit padding, which is the amount of padding around the button that should be considered part of the button's clickable area.

The `ButtonComponentData` class has a number of properties that can be set to customize the behavior and appearance of the button. These include:

- `enabled`: A boolean value that determines whether the button is currently enabled or disabled.
- `active`: A boolean value that determines whether the button is currently active or inactive.
- `imageEntity`: A reference to the entity that contains the button's image.
- `hitPadding`: A `Vec4` object that defines the hit padding around the button.
- `transitionMode`: An enum value that determines the transition mode for the button. The available options are defined in the `constants.js` file.
- `hoverTint`: A `Color` object that defines the tint to apply to the button when it is hovered over.
- `pressedTint`: A `Color` object that defines the tint to apply to the button when it is pressed.
- `inactiveTint`: A `Color` object that defines the tint to apply to the button when it is inactive.
- `fadeDuration`: The duration of the fade animation when the button is transitioned between states.
- `hoverSpriteAsset`: A reference to the asset that contains the sprite to use for the button when it is hovered over.
- `hoverSpriteFrame`: The frame of the sprite to use for the button when it is hovered over.
- `pressedSpriteAsset`: A reference to the asset that contains the sprite to use for the button when it is pressed.
- `pressedSpriteFrame`: The frame of the sprite to use for the button when it is pressed.
- `inactiveSpriteAsset`: A reference to the asset that contains the sprite to use for the button when it is inactive.
- `inactiveSpriteFrame`: The frame of the sprite to use for the button when it is inactive.

This class can be used in the larger PlayCanvas project to define the behavior and appearance of buttons in a PlayCanvas application. For example, a developer could create a new instance of the `ButtonComponentData` class and set its properties to customize the behavior and appearance of a specific button in their application. They could then attach this instance to the entity that represents the button in the PlayCanvas scene.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ButtonComponentData` class?
- The `ButtonComponentData` class is used to store data related to a button component, such as its enabled state, active state, image entity, and various tints and sprites.

2. What is the `BUTTON_TRANSITION_MODE_TINT` constant and where is it defined?
- The `BUTTON_TRANSITION_MODE_TINT` constant is used to specify the transition mode for the button component, and it is imported from a `constants.js` file located in the same directory as this code file.

3. What are the `hoverSpriteAsset`, `hoverSpriteFrame`, `pressedSpriteAsset`, `pressedSpriteFrame`, `inactiveSpriteAsset`, and `inactiveSpriteFrame` properties used for?
- These properties are used to specify the sprite assets and frames to use for the button component in different states, such as when the button is hovered over, pressed, or inactive.
