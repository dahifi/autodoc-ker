This code defines two constants, `SCALEMODE_NONE` and `SCALEMODE_BLEND`, which are used to determine how the `ScreenComponent` should be scaled in relation to the application's resolution. 

The `ScreenComponent` is a component in the PlayCanvas engine that represents a 2D screen or UI element. It contains properties such as width, height, and resolution, which determine how it is displayed on the screen. 

The `SCALEMODE_NONE` constant indicates that the `ScreenComponent` should always use the application's resolution as its own resolution. This means that the `ScreenComponent` will not be scaled up or down to fit the screen, but will instead be displayed at its original size. 

The `SCALEMODE_BLEND` constant indicates that the `ScreenComponent` should be scaled when the application's resolution is different than the `ScreenComponent`'s reference resolution. The reference resolution is the resolution at which the `ScreenComponent` was designed to be displayed. If the application's resolution is higher or lower than the reference resolution, the `ScreenComponent` will be scaled up or down to fit the screen. 

These constants can be used when creating or modifying a `ScreenComponent` to determine how it should be displayed on the screen. For example, if a developer wants a UI element to always be displayed at its original size, they would set the `scaleMode` property of the `ScreenComponent` to `SCALEMODE_NONE`. If they want the UI element to be scaled to fit the screen, they would set the `scaleMode` property to `SCALEMODE_BLEND`. 

Overall, this code provides a simple way for developers to control how their UI elements are displayed on the screen in relation to the application's resolution.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ScreenComponent` in the PlayCanvas engine?
   - The `ScreenComponent` is used to manage the resolution of the application's screen.

2. What is the difference between `SCALEMODE_NONE` and `SCALEMODE_BLEND`?
   - `SCALEMODE_NONE` means that the resolution of the `ScreenComponent` will always match the application's resolution, while `SCALEMODE_BLEND` means that the `ScreenComponent` will be scaled if the application's resolution is different than the `ScreenComponent`'s reference resolution.

3. How can a developer implement these scale modes in their code?
   - The developer can use the constants `SCALEMODE_NONE` and `SCALEMODE_BLEND` to set the scale mode for the `ScreenComponent` in their code.
