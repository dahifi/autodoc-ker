The `AnimComponentLayer` class is a component of the PlayCanvas engine that allows managers to create a single layer of the animation state graph. It is responsible for managing the animations of a single layer and provides methods to control the playback of animations, assign animation tracks to states or blend tree nodes, and transition between states.

The class constructor takes in several parameters, including the name of the layer, the controller to manage the layer's animations, the component that the layer is a member of, the weight of the layer, the blend type of the layer, and whether the weight of the layer should be normalized using the total weight of all layers.

The class provides several getter and setter methods to access and modify the properties of the layer, including the name of the layer, whether the layer is currently playing, whether the layer is playable, the currently active state name, the previously active state name, the currently active state's progress, the currently active state's duration, and whether the layer is currently transitioning between states.

The class also provides methods to control the playback of animations, including `play()`, `pause()`, and `reset()`. Additionally, it provides methods to assign animation tracks to states or blend tree nodes, remove animations from a node in the loaded state graph, and transition between states.

The `update()` method is called every frame and updates the weight of the layer if a blend is in progress and updates the controller.

Overall, the `AnimComponentLayer` class provides a simple and efficient way to manage animations in a single layer of the animation state graph. It is a crucial component of the PlayCanvas engine and is used extensively throughout the project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `AnimComponentLayer` class?
- The `AnimComponentLayer` class allows managers to have a single layer of the animation state graph.

2. What are the parameters of the `constructor` method?
- The `constructor` method takes in the name of the layer, the controller to manage this layer's animations, the component that this layer is a member of, an optional weight value (defaults to 1), an optional blend type (defaults to ANIM_LAYER_OVERWRITE), and an optional boolean value to determine whether the weight of this layer should be normalized using the total weight of all layers.

3. What is the purpose of the `assignAnimation` method?
- The `assignAnimation` method assigns an animation track to a state or blend tree node in the current graph. If a state for the given nodePath doesn't exist, it will be created. If all states nodes are linked and the `AnimComponent`'s `activate` value was set to true then the component will begin playing.
