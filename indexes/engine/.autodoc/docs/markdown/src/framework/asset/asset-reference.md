The `AssetReference` class is responsible for managing the case where an object holds a reference to an asset and needs to be notified when changes occur in the asset. This class is part of the PlayCanvas engine project and is used to enable updating of assets in the engine.

The constructor of the `AssetReference` class takes in several parameters, including the name of the property that the asset is stored under, the parent object that contains the asset reference, the asset registry that stores all assets, and a set of functions called when the asset state changes. These functions include load, add, remove, and unload. The scope to call the callbacks in can also be passed in as a parameter.

The `AssetReference` class has two methods, `set id` and `set url`, which are used to initialize an asset reference. One of either id or url must be set to initialize an asset reference. The `set id` method sets the asset id which this references, while the `set url` method sets the asset url which this references.

The `AssetReference` class also has several private methods, including `_bind`, `_unbind`, `_onLoad`, `_onAdd`, `_onRemove`, and `_onUnload`. These methods are used to bind and unbind events to the asset registry, and to handle the load, add, remove, and unload events.

Overall, the `AssetReference` class is an important part of the PlayCanvas engine project, as it enables updating of assets in the engine. Developers can use this class to manage asset references and to be notified when changes occur in the asset. Below is an example of how to use the `AssetReference` class:

```
var reference = new pc.AssetReference('textureAsset', this, this.app.assets, {
    load: this.onTextureAssetLoad,
    add: this.onTextureAssetAdd,
    remove: this.onTextureAssetRemove
}, this);
reference.id = this.textureAsset.id;
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `AssetReference` class?
- The `AssetReference` class manages the case where an object holds a reference to an asset and needs to be notified when changes occur in the asset, such as load, add, and remove events.

2. What parameters are required to create a new instance of the `AssetReference` class?
- To create a new instance of the `AssetReference` class, the following parameters are required: `propertyName` (string), `parent` (an `Asset` or an object), `registry` (an `AssetRegistry`), and `callbacks` (an object containing functions called when the asset state changes).

3. What are the differences between the `id` and `url` properties of an `AssetReference` instance?
- The `id` and `url` properties of an `AssetReference` instance are used to initialize an asset reference. One of either `id` or `url` must be set. `id` is a number that represents the asset's unique identifier, while `url` is a string that represents the asset's URL.
