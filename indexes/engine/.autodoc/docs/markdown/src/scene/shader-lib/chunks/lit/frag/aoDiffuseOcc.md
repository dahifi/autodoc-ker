The code above is a shader function written in GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) that is used to occlude diffuse lighting. The function takes in a single parameter, `ao`, which stands for ambient occlusion. Ambient occlusion is a shading technique used to simulate the soft shadows that occur when objects are close to each other. 

The purpose of this function is to modify the diffuse lighting of a 3D object by multiplying it with the ambient occlusion value. This results in a darker appearance of the object in areas where ambient occlusion is high, and a brighter appearance in areas where it is low. 

This function is likely used in the larger PlayCanvas engine project to enhance the realism of 3D scenes by simulating the way light interacts with objects in the real world. It can be used in conjunction with other shader functions to create complex lighting effects. 

Here is an example of how this function could be used in a shader:

```
uniform float ao; // ambient occlusion value
varying vec3 vDiffuseLight; // diffuse lighting value

void main() {
    occludeDiffuse(ao); // call the occludeDiffuse function
    gl_FragColor = vec4(vDiffuseLight, 1.0); // set the fragment color to the modified diffuse lighting value
}
```

In this example, the `occludeDiffuse` function is called with the `ao` value passed in as a uniform variable. The resulting modified diffuse lighting value is then used to set the fragment color. 

Overall, this function is a useful tool for creating realistic lighting effects in 3D scenes and is likely an important part of the PlayCanvas engine's shader library.
## Questions: 
 1. What does the `/* glsl */` comment indicate in this code?
   - The `/* glsl */` comment indicates that the code is written in GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language), which is a high-level shading language used for rendering graphics in OpenGL and WebGL.

2. What does the `occludeDiffuse` function do?
   - The `occludeDiffuse` function takes in a float value `ao` and multiplies it with the `dDiffuseLight` variable, which is likely used to adjust the diffuse lighting in a 3D scene based on the ambient occlusion value.

3. What is the purpose of this code within the PlayCanvas engine?
   - Without additional context, it is difficult to determine the specific purpose of this code within the PlayCanvas engine. However, it appears to be a GLSL shader function that could be used for rendering graphics in a 3D scene.
