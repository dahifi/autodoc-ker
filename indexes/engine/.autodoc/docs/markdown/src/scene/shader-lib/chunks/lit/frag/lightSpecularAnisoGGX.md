The code provided is a GLSL shader code that calculates the specular lighting of a material using the Anisotropic GGX model. The purpose of this code is to provide a realistic and accurate way of calculating the specular highlights of a material based on its roughness and anisotropy properties. 

The `calcLightSpecular` function takes in several parameters, including the glossiness of the material, the world normal, the view direction, the half vector, the normalized light direction, and the TBN matrix. It first calculates the roughness and anisotropy values based on the glossiness property. It then calculates the tangent and bitangent vectors of the material using the TBN matrix. 

Next, it calculates the NoH, ToH, and BoH values, which represent the dot products of the world normal with the half vector, the tangent vector with the half vector, and the bitangent vector with the half vector, respectively. These values are used to calculate the anisotropic distribution function (D) of the material. 

The function then calculates the dot products of the view direction and the light direction with the tangent and bitangent vectors, as well as the world normal. These values are used to calculate the lambdaV and lambdaL values, which represent the mean free path of the view and light directions, respectively. Finally, the function calculates the geometry attenuation factor (G) based on these values. 

The `getLightSpecular` function simply calls the `calcLightSpecular` function with the provided parameters and returns the result. 

This code is likely used in the larger PlayCanvas engine project to provide realistic lighting for 3D models and scenes. It can be used in conjunction with other shaders and materials to create a visually appealing and accurate representation of a scene. 

Example usage of this code would involve passing in the necessary parameters to the `getLightSpecular` function, such as the half vector, the reflection direction, the world normal, the view direction, the normalized light direction, and the glossiness of the material. The function would then return the specular lighting value for that particular pixel or vertex.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code calculates the specular lighting for a material using an anisotropic GGX model.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `calcLightSpecular` function?
- The inputs are `gloss` (specular glossiness), `worldNormal` (surface normal in world space), `viewDir` (view direction in world space), `h` (half vector between view and light directions), `lightDirNorm` (normalized light direction in world space), and `tbn` (tangent space matrix). The output is the specular lighting value.

3. What is the role of the `material_anisotropy` variable in this code?
- The `material_anisotropy` variable is used to control the anisotropy of the specular highlight. It is multiplied by the roughness value to determine the anisotropy value used in the calculation.
