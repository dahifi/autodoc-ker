The code provided is a set of functions that encode color values in different formats. These functions are used to convert color values from one format to another, which is useful in computer graphics and game development. The functions are written in GLSL, which is a shading language used in graphics processing units (GPUs) to create visual effects.

The first function, `encodeLinear`, takes a 3-component vector representing a color value in linear space and returns a 4-component vector with the same values and an alpha value of 1. This function is useful when working with color values that are already in linear space, such as when working with HDR (high dynamic range) images.

The second function, `encodeGamma`, takes a 3-component vector representing a color value in linear space and returns a 4-component vector with the same values transformed to gamma space using a power function with an exponent of 1/2.2. This function is useful when working with color values that are in linear space but need to be displayed on a monitor, which typically uses a gamma curve to display colors.

The third function, `encodeRGBM`, takes a 3-component vector representing a color value in linear space and returns a 4-component vector with the same values encoded using a modified RGBM format. This format is used to store high dynamic range color values in a low dynamic range format, such as when storing color values in a texture. The function first applies a power function with an exponent of 0.5 to the color values, then scales them down by a factor of 8. The alpha value is calculated based on the maximum component of the color values and is rounded to the nearest 8-bit value. The color values are then divided by the alpha value to get the final encoded values.

The fourth function, `encodeRGBP`, takes a 3-component vector representing a color value in linear space and returns a 4-component vector with the same values encoded using an RGBP format. This format is similar to RGBM but uses a different encoding scheme. The function first applies a power function with an exponent of 0.5 to the color values, then calculates the maximum component value and scales it to a range of 1 to 8. The scaling factor is then used to calculate the alpha value, which is rounded to the nearest 8-bit value. The color values are then divided by the scaling factor to get the final encoded values.

The fifth function, `encodeRGBE`, takes a 3-component vector representing a color value in linear space and returns a 4-component vector with the same values encoded using an RGBE format. This format is used to store high dynamic range color values in a compact format. The function first calculates the maximum component value and uses it to calculate an exponent value. The color values are then divided by 2 raised to the exponent value, and the exponent value is added to 128 and divided by 255 to get the alpha value. The final encoded values are returned as a 4-component vector.

Overall, these functions are useful for converting color values between different formats, which is important in computer graphics and game development. They can be used in various parts of the PlayCanvas engine, such as when working with textures, lighting, and post-processing effects. For example, the `encodeRGBM` function can be used to store high dynamic range lighting information in a low dynamic range texture, while the `encodeGamma` function can be used to display color values on a monitor with a gamma curve.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code exports five functions that encode different color spaces into a vec4 format.

2. What is the input and output of each function?
- Each function takes a vec3 color source as input and returns a vec4 encoded color as output.

3. What encoding methods are used in this code?
- The code uses various encoding methods such as linear encoding, gamma encoding, modified RGBM encoding, RGBP encoding, and RGBE encoding.
