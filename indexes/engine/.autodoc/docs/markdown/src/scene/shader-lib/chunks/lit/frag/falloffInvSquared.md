The code provided is a set of two functions that calculate the falloff of a light source in a 3D environment. The first function, `getFalloffWindow`, takes in two parameters: `lightRadius`, which is the radius of the light source, and `lightDir`, which is the direction of the light source. The function calculates the squared distance between the light source and the object it is illuminating, and then calculates the inverse radius of the light source. It then returns the square of the result of the `saturate` function applied to the difference between 1 and the square of the squared distance multiplied by the square of the inverse radius. This calculation is used to determine the intensity of the light at a given point in the scene, with the falloff increasing as the distance from the light source increases.

The second function, `getFalloffInvSquared`, also takes in `lightRadius` and `lightDir` as parameters. It calculates the squared distance between the light source and the object it is illuminating, and then calculates the inverse radius of the light source. It then multiplies the result of the `saturate` function applied to the difference between 1 and the square of the squared distance multiplied by the square of the inverse radius by 16. This calculation is used to determine the intensity of the light at a given point in the scene, with the falloff increasing more rapidly as the distance from the light source increases compared to the `getFalloffWindow` function.

These functions are likely used in the larger PlayCanvas engine project to calculate the falloff of light sources in a 3D environment. This is an important aspect of creating realistic lighting in a scene, as it allows for the intensity of light to decrease as the distance from the light source increases. The `getFalloffWindow` function may be used for light sources that have a more gradual falloff, while the `getFalloffInvSquared` function may be used for light sources that have a more rapid falloff. These functions may be called by other functions or scripts within the PlayCanvas engine project to determine the intensity of light at a given point in the scene. 

Example usage of `getFalloffWindow`:

```
const lightRadius = 10;
const lightDir = new pc.Vec3(0, 1, 0);
const distanceFromLight = 5;
const intensity = getFalloffWindow(lightRadius, lightDir) / (distanceFromLight * distanceFromLight);
```

Example usage of `getFalloffInvSquared`:

```
const lightRadius = 10;
const lightDir = new pc.Vec3(0, 1, 0);
const distanceFromLight = 5;
const intensity = getFalloffInvSquared(lightRadius, lightDir) / (distanceFromLight * distanceFromLight);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code calculates the falloff of a light source based on its radius and direction.

2. What are the inputs required for this code to work?
   - This code requires two inputs: the radius of the light source and the direction of the light.

3. What is the output of this code?
   - This code returns a float value that represents the falloff of the light source.
