This code is a shader code written in GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) and it defines a uniform variable `matrix_view` of type `mat4` which represents the view matrix. The view matrix is used to transform the world coordinates into view coordinates, which is the coordinate system relative to the camera. 

The `getViewNormal()` function returns the normal vector of the current vertex in view space. It does this by multiplying the world normal vector `vNormalW` with the upper-left 3x3 submatrix of the view matrix `matrix_view`. This is because the normal vector needs to be transformed by the inverse transpose of the model-view matrix to maintain its perpendicularity to the surface after transformation. 

This code is a part of the PlayCanvas engine project and is used to render 3D graphics. The view matrix is an essential component of the rendering pipeline as it determines the position and orientation of the camera in the scene. The `getViewNormal()` function is used to calculate the normal vector of the vertex in view space, which is used in lighting calculations to determine the amount of light reflected off the surface. 

Here is an example of how this code can be used in a PlayCanvas project:

```javascript
// create a new material
var material = new pc.StandardMaterial();

// set the shader code
material.chunks.viewNormal = /* glsl */`
    #ifndef VIEWMATRIX
    #define VIEWMATRIX
    uniform mat4 matrix_view;
    #endif

    vec3 getViewNormal() {
        return mat3(matrix_view) * vNormalW;
    }
`;

// set the material on a mesh instance
var meshInstance = new pc.MeshInstance(node, mesh, material);
``` 

In this example, a new material is created and the `chunks.viewNormal` property is set to the shader code. This will ensure that the `getViewNormal()` function is included in the shader code when the material is used to render a mesh instance.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `#ifndef VIEWMATRIX` and `#define VIEWMATRIX` statements?**\
These statements are used to ensure that the `matrix_view` uniform is only defined once in the code, preventing any potential errors that could arise from multiple definitions.

2. **What is the data type of `matrix_view`?**\
Based on the `mat4` keyword used to define it, `matrix_view` is likely a 4x4 matrix data type.

3. **What is the purpose of the `getViewNormal()` function?**\
The `getViewNormal()` function returns the normal vector of the current view, which is calculated by multiplying the `vNormalW` vector by the `matrix_view` uniform after converting it to a 3x3 matrix.
