The code above is a GLSL shader code that is used to add ambient lighting to a 3D scene. The code is a part of the PlayCanvas engine project and is used to render 3D graphics in real-time. 

The code starts with an export statement that exports the code as a default module. The code defines a uniform sampler2D variable called texture_envAtlas that is used to sample the environment map. The environment map is a texture that is used to simulate the reflection of the environment on the surface of the 3D object. 

The addAmbient function takes a vec3 worldNormal as an input parameter. The worldNormal is the normal vector of the surface of the 3D object. The function first rotates the worldNormal vector using the cubeMapRotate function. The cubeMapRotate function is used to rotate the normal vector to the orientation of the environment map. The function then calculates the direction vector of the reflected light using the rotated normal vector. 

The function then calculates the spherical coordinates of the direction vector using the toSphericalUv function. The toSphericalUv function is used to convert the direction vector to spherical coordinates. The function then maps the spherical coordinates to the texture coordinates of the environment map using the mapUv function. The mapUv function is used to map the spherical coordinates to the texture coordinates of the environment map. 

The function then samples the environment map using the texture2D function and the texture coordinates calculated in the previous step. The sampled color is then decoded using the $DECODE function. The $DECODE function is a built-in function in the PlayCanvas engine that is used to decode the color value from the texture. The decoded color value is then passed to the processEnvironment function. The processEnvironment function is a built-in function in the PlayCanvas engine that is used to process the environment map and calculate the diffuse lighting. 

In summary, the code above is a GLSL shader code that is used to add ambient lighting to a 3D scene. The code uses an environment map to simulate the reflection of the environment on the surface of the 3D object. The code calculates the direction vector of the reflected light and maps it to the texture coordinates of the environment map. The code then samples the environment map and decodes the color value. The decoded color value is then passed to the processEnvironment function to calculate the diffuse lighting.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `addAmbient` function?
    
    The `addAmbient` function is used to add ambient lighting to a scene based on a given world normal.

2. What is the significance of the `texture_envAtlas` uniform and how is it used in the code?
    
    The `texture_envAtlas` uniform is a sampler2D used to sample a texture atlas containing environment maps. It is used to retrieve the environment map for a given direction in the `addAmbient` function.

3. What is the purpose of the `mapUv` function and how is it used in the code?
    
    The `mapUv` function is used to map a direction vector to a UV coordinate in the environment map atlas. It takes in a spherical UV coordinate and a vector representing the size of the atlas and returns the corresponding UV coordinate in the atlas. This UV coordinate is then used to sample the environment map in the `addAmbient` function.
