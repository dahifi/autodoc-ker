The code provided is a function called `combineColor` that takes in three parameters: `albedo`, `sheenSpecularity`, and `clearcoatSpecularity`. The function returns a `vec3` value that represents the combined color of the input parameters.

The purpose of this function is to calculate the final color of a material based on various lighting and shading models. The function takes into account different lighting models such as diffuse, specular, reflections, sheen, and clearcoat. The function uses pre-defined variables such as `dDiffuseLight`, `dSpecularLight`, `dReflection`, `sSpecularLight`, `sReflection`, `ccFresnel`, `ccSpecularLight`, and `ccReflection` to calculate the final color.

The function first calculates the diffuse lighting contribution to the final color. If the `LIT_OLD_AMBIENT` flag is defined, the function subtracts the global ambient light from the diffuse light and multiplies it by the material's ambient color. Otherwise, it multiplies the diffuse light by the albedo color. The function then adds the specular lighting contribution if the `LIT_SPECULAR` flag is defined. It also adds the reflection contribution if the `LIT_REFLECTIONS` flag is defined.

If the `LIT_SHEEN` flag is defined, the function calculates the sheen contribution to the final color. It first calculates a scaling factor based on the maximum value of the `sheenSpecularity` vector and multiplies it by a constant value. It then multiplies the diffuse color by the scaling factor and adds the sheen specular and reflection contributions multiplied by the `sheenSpecularity` vector.

If the `LIT_CLEARCOAT` flag is defined, the function calculates the clearcoat contribution to the final color. It first calculates a scaling factor based on the fresnel term and the `clearcoatSpecularity` value. It then multiplies the diffuse color by the scaling factor and adds the clearcoat specular and reflection contributions multiplied by the `clearcoatSpecularity` value.

Overall, this function is an important part of the PlayCanvas engine as it calculates the final color of a material based on various lighting and shading models. It can be used in conjunction with other functions and classes in the engine to create visually appealing 3D scenes and games. Here is an example usage of the `combineColor` function:

```
const albedo = vec3(1, 0.5, 0.2);
const sheenSpecularity = vec3(0.2, 0.4, 0.6);
const clearcoatSpecularity = 0.8;

const finalColor = combineColor(albedo, sheenSpecularity, clearcoatSpecularity);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What does this code do?
   - This code defines a function called `combineColor` that takes in three parameters (`albedo`, `sheenSpecularity`, and `clearcoatSpecularity`) and returns a `vec3` value.
2. What is the purpose of the `#ifdef` statements in this code?
   - The `#ifdef` statements are used to conditionally include or exclude certain parts of the code based on whether certain preprocessor macros are defined or not.
3. What is the significance of the calculations involving `sheenScaling` and `clearCoatScaling`?
   - `sheenScaling` and `clearCoatScaling` are used to adjust the contribution of the sheen and clearcoat components to the final color value based on their respective specularity values.
