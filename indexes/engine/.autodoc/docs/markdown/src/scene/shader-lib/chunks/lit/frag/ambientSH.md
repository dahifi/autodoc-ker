This code is a shader function that calculates ambient lighting for a 3D scene using spherical harmonics. The purpose of this code is to add ambient lighting to a scene by calculating the color of the ambient light based on the orientation of the surface normal at each point in the scene. 

The `ambientSH` uniform is an array of 9 vec3 values that represent the coefficients of the spherical harmonics used to calculate the ambient lighting. These coefficients are precomputed and stored in the `ambientSH` array, and are used to calculate the color of the ambient light at each point in the scene.

The `addAmbient` function takes a `worldNormal` vec3 as input, which represents the surface normal of the point in the scene where the ambient lighting is being calculated. The `cubeMapRotate` function is called to rotate the surface normal to the appropriate orientation for the spherical harmonics calculation.

The color of the ambient light is then calculated using the `ambientSH` coefficients and the rotated surface normal. The resulting color is added to the `dDiffuseLight` variable, which is used to calculate the final color of the scene.

This code is an important part of the PlayCanvas engine, as it provides a way to add realistic ambient lighting to 3D scenes. It is used in conjunction with other shaders and lighting techniques to create a visually appealing and realistic scene. 

Example usage of this code would be to include it in a shader program for a 3D model in a game or simulation. The `ambientSH` coefficients would be precomputed and passed to the shader as a uniform variable. The `addAmbient` function would be called for each point in the scene where ambient lighting is needed, and the resulting color would be added to the `dDiffuseLight` variable to calculate the final color of the scene.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ambientSH` uniform variable?
- The `ambientSH` uniform variable is used to store the coefficients of the ambient lighting in a spherical harmonics basis.

2. What does the `addAmbient` function do?
- The `addAmbient` function calculates the ambient lighting contribution based on the world normal and the coefficients stored in `ambientSH`, and adds it to the `dDiffuseLight` variable after processing it with the `processEnvironment` function.

3. What is the significance of the `/* glsl */` comment at the beginning of the code?
- The `/* glsl */` comment indicates that the code is written in GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) syntax, which is a C-like language used to write shaders for graphics processing units (GPUs).
