The `Immediate` class in the PlayCanvas engine project is responsible for rendering debug lines and shapes in the game engine. It is used to draw simple shapes and lines that are useful for debugging and visualizing game objects. The class is initialized with a reference to the device object, which is used to create and manage graphics resources.

The `Immediate` class contains several methods for drawing different types of shapes, including wireframe boxes and spheres. These shapes are drawn using a set of vertices and colors that are passed to the graphics device. The class also contains methods for creating and managing materials used for rendering the shapes.

The `Immediate` class uses a set of `ImmediateBatches` objects to manage the rendering of the debug lines and shapes. Each `ImmediateBatches` object is associated with a layer in the game engine, and contains a set of line batches for that layer. The `Immediate` class maintains a map of `ImmediateBatches` objects for each layer in the game engine.

When a shape is drawn using the `Immediate` class, it is added to the appropriate `ImmediateBatches` object for the current layer. The `Immediate` class also maintains a set of all `ImmediateBatches` objects that were used in the current frame, as well as a set of all layers that were updated during the frame.

The `Immediate` class also contains methods for creating and managing shaders used for rendering the debug shapes. These shaders are simple vertex and fragment shaders that are used to render the shapes with the appropriate materials.

Overall, the `Immediate` class is an important part of the PlayCanvas engine project, as it provides a simple and efficient way to render debug lines and shapes in the game engine. It is used extensively throughout the engine for debugging and visualization purposes.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Immediate` class?
- The `Immediate` class is used for rendering debug lines and shapes in real-time.

2. What is the `getBatch` method used for?
- The `getBatch` method is used to retrieve a batch for rendering lines to a specific layer with the required depth testing state.

3. What is the purpose of the `onPreRenderLayer` method?
- The `onPreRenderLayer` method is called just before the layer is rendered to allow lines for the layer to be added from inside the frame getting rendered. It updates line batches for the specified sub-layer and adds mesh instances for the specified layer to the visible list.
