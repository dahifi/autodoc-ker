The code defines a helper class called `CookieRenderer` that is used by the PlayCanvas engine to render cookies into a texture atlas. Cookies are textures that are used to add additional detail to lighting in a scene. The `CookieRenderer` class is used by the clustered lighting system to render cookies into the texture atlas, similar to the shadow renderer.

The `CookieRenderer` class has a constructor that takes a `device` and a `lightTextureAtlas` as arguments. The `device` is an object that represents the graphics device used by the engine, and the `lightTextureAtlas` is a texture atlas that is used to store the cookies.

The `CookieRenderer` class has a `render` method that takes a `light` and a `renderTarget` as arguments. The `light` is an object that represents a light in the scene, and the `renderTarget` is the render target that the cookies will be rendered to. The `render` method checks if the light is enabled, has a cookie, and is visible in the current frame. If these conditions are met, the method renders the cookie to the render target.

The `CookieRenderer` class has a `destroy` method that is currently empty. This method can be used to clean up any resources that were created by the `CookieRenderer` class.

The `CookieRenderer` class has several private methods and properties that are used to render the cookies. These include `getShader`, `shader2d`, `shaderCube`, `createTexture`, `_invViewProjMatrices`, and `initInvViewProjMatrices`. These methods and properties are used to create and manage the shaders and textures that are used to render the cookies.

The `CookieRenderer` class uses several other classes and constants from the PlayCanvas engine, including `Vec4`, `Mat4`, `ADDRESS_CLAMP_TO_EDGE`, `FILTER_NEAREST`, `PIXELFORMAT_RGBA8`, `DebugGraphics`, `drawQuadWithShader`, `Texture`, `LIGHTTYPE_OMNI`, `createShaderFromCode`, `LightCamera`, and `BlendState`. These classes and constants are used to create and manage the graphics resources that are used to render the cookies.

Overall, the `CookieRenderer` class is an important part of the PlayCanvas engine's lighting system. It allows cookies to be rendered into a texture atlas, which can then be used to add additional detail to lighting in a scene.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `CookieRenderer` class?
- The `CookieRenderer` class is a helper class used by the clustered lighting system to render cookies into the texture atlas, similarly to the shadow renderer.

2. What is the difference between `textureBlitFragmentShader` and `textureCubeBlitFragmentShader`?
- `textureBlitFragmentShader` is used for 2D textures, while `textureCubeBlitFragmentShader` is used for cubemaps. The latter uses the inverse view projection matrices for the 6 faces to copy the cubemap faces into the atlas.

3. What is the significance of the `invViewProjId` uniform?
- The `invViewProjId` uniform is used to pass the inverse view projection matrix to the shader, which is used to convert the UV coordinates of the cubemap faces to world space positions for sampling the texture.
