The code defines a base class called `RefCountedObject` that implements reference counting for objects. Reference counting is a technique used to manage memory in programming languages where objects are automatically deleted when they are no longer needed. The purpose of this class is to keep track of the number of references to an object and delete it when the reference count reaches zero.

The class has a private property `_refCount` that is initialized to zero. It also has two methods `incRefCount()` and `decRefCount()` that increment and decrement the reference count respectively. The `get` accessor method `refCount` returns the current reference count.

This class can be used as a base class for other classes that need reference counting. For example, in the PlayCanvas engine, this class may be used in the implementation of game objects, resources, and other objects that need to be managed by the engine. When an object is created, its reference count is set to one. When another object references it, the reference count is incremented. When an object is no longer needed, the reference count is decremented. If the reference count reaches zero, the object is deleted.

Here is an example of how this class can be used:

```
import { RefCountedObject } from 'playcanvas-engine';

class MyObject extends RefCountedObject {
    constructor() {
        super();
        // other initialization code
    }
}

let obj1 = new MyObject();
let obj2 = new MyObject();

obj1.incRefCount();
obj2.incRefCount();

obj1.decRefCount();
obj2.decRefCount();
```

In this example, two instances of `MyObject` are created and their reference count is incremented. When the reference count is decremented, the objects are not deleted because their reference count is still greater than zero. When the `decRefCount()` method is called again, the reference count reaches zero and the objects are deleted.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `RefCountedObject` class?
- The `RefCountedObject` class implements reference counting for objects.

2. What is the significance of the `_refCount` property being marked as `@private`?
- The `@private` tag indicates that `_refCount` is intended to be used only within the class and not accessed from outside.

3. How can the reference count be incremented or decremented?
- The reference count can be incremented using the `incRefCount()` method and decremented using the `decRefCount()` method.
