This code defines several constants that represent different interpolation schemes. Interpolation is the process of estimating values between two known values. In the context of computer graphics, interpolation is often used to create smooth animations between two keyframes. 

The first two constants, `CURVE_LINEAR` and `CURVE_SMOOTHSTEP`, represent simple linear and smooth step interpolation schemes, respectively. Linear interpolation simply draws a straight line between two points, while smooth step interpolation uses a smooth curve to transition between two values. 

The next two constants, `CURVE_CATMULL` and `CURVE_CARDINAL`, represent deprecated interpolation schemes that were once used in the PlayCanvas engine. These have been replaced by the `CURVE_SPLINE` constant, which represents a more general spline interpolation scheme. Spline interpolation uses a series of curves to create a smooth transition between two values. 

Finally, the `CURVE_STEP` constant represents a stepped interpolator, which does not blend between values but instead jumps directly from one value to the next. This can be useful for creating discrete animations or for representing digital signals that can only take on certain values. 

These constants can be used throughout the PlayCanvas engine to specify different interpolation schemes for animations and other visual effects. For example, a developer might use the `CURVE_SPLINE` constant to create a smooth camera movement between two points in a 3D scene. Alternatively, they might use the `CURVE_STEP` constant to create a flashing effect for a warning sign. 

Overall, this code provides a useful set of tools for creating smooth and realistic animations in the PlayCanvas engine. By defining these constants, the engine makes it easy for developers to experiment with different interpolation schemes and find the one that works best for their particular use case.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines different interpolation schemes for use in animations.

2. What is the difference between the deprecated interpolation schemes and the CURVE_SPLINE scheme?
- The deprecated schemes are no longer recommended for use and should be replaced with CURVE_SPLINE. 

3. How can the CURVE_SPLINE scheme be customized?
- For Catmull-Rom interpolation, a curve tension of 0.5 can be specified.
