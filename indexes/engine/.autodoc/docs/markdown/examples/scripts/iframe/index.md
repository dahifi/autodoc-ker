This code is responsible for building examples for the PlayCanvas engine. It copies prebuilt files used by the iframe, reads HTML templates, and compiles them using Handlebars. It also reads example files, extracts the example class from the file, and generates an HTML file for each example. 

The code starts by importing the necessary modules, including `fs`, `fse`, `Babel`, `Handlebars`, `formatters`, `readDirectoryNames`, `dirname`, and `fileURLToPath`. It then sets the `__filename` and `__dirname` variables using `fileURLToPath` and `dirname`. The `MAIN_DIR` variable is set to the parent directory of the current directory.

The code then copies prebuilt files used by the iframe from the `build` directory to the `dist/build` directory. It also copies several polyfill files to the `dist/build` directory. 

The `loadHtmlTemplate` function reads an HTML template file and compiles it using Handlebars. It returns the compiled template with the provided data.

The `buildExample` function reads an example file and extracts the example class from it using `formatters.getExampleClassFromTextFile`. It then determines the engine type from the example class using `formatters.getEngineTypeFromClass` and sets the `enginePath` variable accordingly. It then writes an HTML file for the example using the `loadHtmlTemplate` function and the example class, engine path, and other data.

The code then checks if the `dist/iframe` directory exists and creates it if it does not. If the `EXAMPLE` and `CATEGORY` environment variables are set, it calls the `buildExample` function with the provided category and example file. Otherwise, it reads all the example categories using `readDirectoryNames` and reads all the example files for each category using `fs.readdirSync`. It then calls the `buildExample` function for each example file that does not include `index.mjs`.

Overall, this code is responsible for building HTML files for the PlayCanvas engine examples. It reads example files, extracts the example class, and generates an HTML file for each example. It also copies prebuilt files and polyfills used by the iframe. This code is an important part of the PlayCanvas engine project as it allows developers to easily build and test examples for the engine.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `copyFileSync` function calls?
- The `copyFileSync` function calls are used to copy prebuilt files to the `dist/build/` directory, including polyfills and the PlayCanvas observer.

2. What is the `loadHtmlTemplate` function used for?
- The `loadHtmlTemplate` function is used to load an HTML template file and compile it using Handlebars, returning the compiled template with the provided data.

3. What is the purpose of the `buildExample` function?
- The `buildExample` function is used to build an example by reading a text file, getting the example class from the file using Babel, and writing an HTML file to the `dist/iframe/` directory with the compiled template and example data.
