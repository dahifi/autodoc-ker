This code is not a part of the PlayCanvas engine project, but rather a comment explaining the origin and modifications made to a 3D model used in the project. The model is a portal frame obtained from Sketchfab under a Creative Commons license. The modifications made to the model include resizing and compressing the texture to minimize its size.

This comment serves as a reference for anyone working with the PlayCanvas engine project and using this particular 3D model. It ensures that proper credit is given to the original creator and that any modifications made to the model are documented. Additionally, the information about the texture being resized and compressed can be useful for optimizing the performance of the project.

While this code does not contain any actual code, it is still an important part of the project's documentation and serves as an example of the importance of proper documentation in software development.
