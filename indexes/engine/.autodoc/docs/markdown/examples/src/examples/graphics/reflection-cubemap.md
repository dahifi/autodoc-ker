The `ReflectionCubemapExample` class is an example of how to use the PlayCanvas engine to create a 3D scene with a reflective cubemap. The purpose of this code is to demonstrate how to create a shiny ball that reflects the environment around it, and how to project that environment onto different types of textures. 

The `example` method takes an HTML canvas element and a device type as arguments. It creates a graphics device using the `pc.createGraphicsDevice` method, which initializes the WebGL context and sets up the rendering pipeline. It then creates an `AppBase` instance, which is the main entry point for the PlayCanvas engine. 

The `example` method loads a set of assets, including a cubemap texture and a script that handles cubemap rendering. It then sets up the scene by creating a skydome, a green plane, a camera, and a directional light. It also creates a high-quality sphere that will reflect the environment around it. 

The `example` method then sets up the shiny ball by adding a camera component to it and a script component that handles cubemap rendering. It also creates several textures that will be used to project the cubemap onto different shapes. 

Finally, the `example` method updates the scene each frame by rotating the primitives around their center and orbiting them around the shiny sphere. It also projects the cubemap onto different textures and displays them on the screen. 

Overall, this code demonstrates how to create a 3D scene with a reflective cubemap using the PlayCanvas engine. It shows how to set up the scene, create a shiny ball that reflects the environment, and project the environment onto different textures. This code can be used as a starting point for creating more complex 3D scenes with reflective surfaces.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `example` function in this code?
- The `example` function is used to set up and run a graphics example using the PlayCanvas engine.

2. What is the role of the `shinyBall` entity in this code?
- The `shinyBall` entity is used to render a high-polygon sphere and generate a dynamic cubemap for use in the example.

3. What is the purpose of the `createPrimitive` function in this code?
- The `createPrimitive` function is used to create a primitive shape with a specified position, scale, color, and layer, and add it to the scene.
