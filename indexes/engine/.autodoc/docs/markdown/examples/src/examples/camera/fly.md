The code defines a class called `FlyExample` that contains a method called `example`. This method creates a 3D scene using the PlayCanvas engine and populates it with boxes, lights, and a camera. The purpose of this code is to demonstrate how to create a fly camera in PlayCanvas.

The `example` method takes two parameters: a canvas element and a device type. It creates a new PlayCanvas application using the canvas element and sets up a mouse and keyboard input. It then loads a script asset called `fly-camera.js` that contains the fly camera logic. Once the asset is loaded, it sets the ambient light of the scene to a dark gray color and starts the application.

The method then defines two helper functions: `createMaterial` and `createBox`. `createMaterial` takes a `pc.Color` object and returns a new `pc.StandardMaterial` with the diffuse color set to the input color. `createBox` takes a position, size, and material and creates a new box entity with a model component of type 'box'. It sets the position, scale, and material of the box and adds it to the scene hierarchy.

The method then uses these helper functions to create a few red boxes and a white floor in the scene. It also creates an omni-directional light and adds it to the scene hierarchy. Finally, it creates a new camera entity with a camera component and a fly camera script component. It sets the position of the camera and adds it to the scene hierarchy.

Overall, this code demonstrates how to create a simple 3D scene with PlayCanvas and how to add a fly camera to it. It can be used as a starting point for more complex 3D applications that require user-controlled cameras.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `FlyExample` class?
- The `FlyExample` class is an example of how to create a fly camera in the PlayCanvas engine.

2. What dependencies does the `example` method of the `FlyExample` class have?
- The `example` method of the `FlyExample` class has a dependency on an HTML canvas element and a string representing the device type.

3. What does the `createBox` function do?
- The `createBox` function creates a new entity in the PlayCanvas engine with a model component of type 'box', a specified position and size, and a specified material.
