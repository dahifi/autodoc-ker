The code is an example of how to use the PlayCanvas engine to create a UI element with text that automatically adjusts its font size to fit within its container. The example is called "Text Auto Font Size" and is located in the "User Interface" category. The code imports the PlayCanvas engine and defines a class called "TextAutoFontSizeExample". 

The "example" method of this class takes an HTML canvas element and a device type as input. It then creates a graphics device using the "createGraphicsDevice" method of the PlayCanvas engine, passing in the canvas and device options. It also creates an "AppOptions" object that specifies the graphics device, mouse, touch, and element input. 

The code then creates a new PlayCanvas application using the "AppBase" constructor and initializes it with the options. It sets the canvas to fill the window and automatically change resolution to be the same as the canvas size. 

The code then loads a font asset and creates a camera and a 2D screen entity. It also creates a container entity with an image component and a text element with auto font size, and places it inside the container. The text element is set up to take the entire parent space and adjust its font size to fit within the container. 

Finally, the code updates the container's size to showcase the auto-sizing feature. It does this by adding an event listener for the "update" event and changing the container's width and height based on a sine wave over time. 

Overall, this code demonstrates how to use the PlayCanvas engine to create a UI element with text that automatically adjusts its font size to fit within its container. It shows how to create a graphics device, initialize a PlayCanvas application, load assets, create entities, and update them over time. This example can be used as a starting point for creating more complex UI elements with the PlayCanvas engine.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is an example of how to use the PlayCanvas engine to create a 2D screen with a container entity that has an auto-sizing text element.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
- This code imports the PlayCanvas engine from a relative path and uses two external URLs for glslang and twgsl.

3. What is the significance of the `WEBGPU_ENABLED` property?
- The `WEBGPU_ENABLED` property is a boolean that indicates whether the example is compatible with the WebGPU API, which is a new graphics API for the web that is currently in development.
