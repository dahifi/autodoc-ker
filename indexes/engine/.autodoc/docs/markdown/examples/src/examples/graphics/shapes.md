The code defines a class called `ShapesExample` that contains a single method called `example`. The purpose of this method is to create a simple 3D scene that displays various primitive shapes using the PlayCanvas engine. 

The `example` method takes two arguments: a `canvas` element and a `deviceType` string. The `canvas` element is used to create a `GraphicsDevice` object, which is then used to initialize a new `AppBase` object. The `deviceType` string is used to specify the type of graphics device to create (e.g. "webgl2" or "webgpu").

Once the `AppBase` object is created and initialized, the method proceeds to create a number of entities that represent different primitive shapes (e.g. box, plane, sphere, etc.). Each entity is given a `render` component that specifies the type of shape to render. The entities are then added to the scene and positioned in a grid layout.

In addition to the primitive shapes, the method also creates an entity with a `light` component and an entity with a `camera` component. The `light` component is a directional light that is positioned at an angle to illuminate the scene. The `camera` component is used to render the scene from a particular viewpoint.

Overall, the purpose of this code is to demonstrate how to use the PlayCanvas engine to create a simple 3D scene with primitive shapes, lighting, and a camera. This code could be used as a starting point for more complex 3D applications that require similar functionality. For example, a game developer could use this code to create a prototype of a 3D game level that includes basic geometry and lighting. 

Example usage:

```javascript
import ShapesExample from 'path/to/ShapesExample';

const canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');
const deviceType = 'webgl2';

const shapesExample = new ShapesExample();
shapesExample.example(canvas, deviceType);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ShapesExample` class?
- The `ShapesExample` class is an example class that demonstrates how to create and render primitive shapes using the PlayCanvas engine.

2. What is the significance of the `WEBGPU_ENABLED` property?
- The `WEBGPU_ENABLED` property is a boolean value that indicates whether the example can be run using the WebGPU API.

3. What are the different component systems and resource handlers being used in the `createOptions` object?
- The `createOptions` object includes the `componentSystems` array, which contains `RenderComponentSystem`, `CameraComponentSystem`, and `LightComponentSystem`, and the `resourceHandlers` array, which contains `TextureHandler` and `ContainerHandler`. These are all systems and handlers that are used by the PlayCanvas engine to manage different types of components and resources.
