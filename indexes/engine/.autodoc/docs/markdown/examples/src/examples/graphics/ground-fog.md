The code defines a class called `GroundFogExample` that demonstrates how to create a custom fog shader in the PlayCanvas engine. The class has a static `CATEGORY` and `NAME` properties that define the category and name of the example in the PlayCanvas editor. It also has a static `WEBGPU_ENABLED` property that indicates whether the example is supported on WebGPU.

The class has a `controls` method that returns a React component that renders a panel with a boolean input control for toggling the softness of the fog. The control is bound to an Observer object that is passed as an argument to the method.

The class has an `example` method that takes a canvas element, a device type, a files object, and a data object as arguments. The method creates a PlayCanvas application with the specified graphics device and component systems. It loads several assets, including a terrain model, a texture, and a custom shader. It creates a camera entity with an orbit camera script and a directional light entity with cascaded shadows. It creates a subdivided plane mesh and a ground entity with a custom material that uses the custom shader and the texture asset. The method updates the time and the softness of the fog in the material parameters based on the data object. It also renders the depth texture in the corner of the canvas for debugging purposes.

The purpose of the code is to demonstrate how to create a custom fog shader in the PlayCanvas engine and how to use it in a PlayCanvas application. The code can be used as a starting point for creating more complex fog effects or for integrating custom shaders into PlayCanvas applications. The code can also be used as a reference for using the PlayCanvas API to create and manipulate entities, assets, materials, and shaders.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `controls` method in this code?
- The `controls` method returns a React component that contains UI controls for the example, specifically a toggle for adjusting the softness of the fog.

2. What assets are loaded and used in this example?
- The example loads four assets: a script, a container, a texture, and a cubemap. These assets are used to create a terrain, a skydome, a camera, and a directional light with cascaded shadows.

3. What does the `example` method do?
- The `example` method sets up a PlayCanvas application, loads the necessary assets, creates entities and components for the scene, sets up a custom fog shader, and updates the scene on each frame. It also includes event listeners for resizing the canvas and updating the softness of the fog.
