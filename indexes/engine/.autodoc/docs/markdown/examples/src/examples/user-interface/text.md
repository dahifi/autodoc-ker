The `TextExample` class is a code example that demonstrates how to use the PlayCanvas engine to create text elements in a 2D screen. The purpose of this code is to show how to create different types of text elements, such as basic text, markup text with wrap, text with outline, and text with drop shadow. 

The `example` method takes two parameters: a canvas element and a device type. It creates a graphics device using the `createGraphicsDevice` method and initializes a new PlayCanvas application using the `AppBase` class. It then loads the required assets, starts the application, and creates a camera and a 2D screen. Finally, it creates four text entities and adds them to the screen entity.

The `TextExample` class is useful for developers who want to create text elements in their PlayCanvas projects. The code demonstrates how to use the `element` component to create different types of text elements with various properties, such as font size, color, outline, and shadow. Developers can use this code as a starting point to create their own text elements with custom properties.

Here is an example of how to use the `TextExample` class:

```javascript
import TextExample from './TextExample.js';

const canvas = document.getElementById('application-canvas');
const deviceType = 'webgl2'; // or 'webgl1' or 'webgpu'

const textExample = new TextExample();
textExample.example(canvas, deviceType);
```

This code creates a new instance of the `TextExample` class and calls the `example` method with a canvas element and a device type. The `example` method creates text elements and adds them to the screen entity, which is displayed on the canvas. Developers can modify the code to create their own text elements with custom properties.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is an example of how to use the PlayCanvas engine to create text elements with different styles and effects.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code imports the entire PlayCanvas library, and also requires external font and shader files.

3. What is the expected output of this code?
- The expected output of this code is a canvas element with four text elements, each with different styles and effects applied.
