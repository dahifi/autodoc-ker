The code is an example of how to use VR controllers in a PlayCanvas engine project. The `VrControllersExample` class is a static class that has a single method called `example`. The method takes two parameters: a canvas element and a device type. The method creates a PlayCanvas application instance and sets up the canvas element as the rendering target. It also loads a 3D model of a VR controller and creates a grid of cubes. 

The method then checks if the browser supports WebXR. If it does, it sets up event listeners for mouse and touch input to activate VR mode. When VR mode is activated, the method creates a camera entity and starts the VR session. It also creates a controller entity for each input source (e.g. a VR controller) that is added to the session. The position and rotation of each controller entity is updated every frame based on the input source's position and rotation. 

If the browser does not support WebXR, the method displays a message indicating that WebXR is not supported. 

The `VrControllersExample` class can be used as a starting point for implementing VR controller support in a PlayCanvas engine project. Developers can modify the code to suit their specific needs, such as changing the 3D model of the VR controller or adding custom logic for handling input from the controllers. 

Example usage:

```javascript
import VrControllersExample from 'path/to/VrControllersExample';

const canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');
const deviceType = 'vr'; // or 'ar' for augmented reality

VrControllersExample.example(canvas, deviceType);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is an example of how to use VR controllers with the PlayCanvas engine.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code imports the entire PlayCanvas library and uses HTML and CSS.

3. What is the expected output of this code?
- The expected output is a PlayCanvas application that allows the user to enter VR mode and see and interact with virtual controllers.
