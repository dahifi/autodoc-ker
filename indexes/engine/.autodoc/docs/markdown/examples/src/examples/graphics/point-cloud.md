The `PointCloudExample` class is a part of the PlayCanvas engine project and is responsible for rendering a point cloud model on a canvas element. The `example` method of this class takes three arguments: a canvas element, a device type, and an object containing two shader files. 

The method creates a new PlayCanvas application and loads a 3D model of a statue. It then creates a camera entity and adds it to the scene hierarchy. The method also creates a new entity from the loaded 3D model and adds it to the scene hierarchy. 

The method then creates a new shader definition using the vertex and fragment shader files passed as arguments. It creates a new material using this shader and assigns it to all mesh instances of the 3D model entity. The material is set to render as points, and the point size and color are determined by the vertex shader. 

The method also sets up an update loop that rotates the 3D model entity and updates the time parameter of the vertex shader. 

Overall, this code demonstrates how to load a 3D model, apply a custom shader to it, and render it as a point cloud. It can be used as a starting point for creating more complex 3D visualizations and simulations using the PlayCanvas engine. 

Example usage:

```
const canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');
const deviceType = 'web';
const shaderFiles = {
  'shader.vert': /* glsl */`
    // vertex shader code here
  `,
  'shader.frag': /* glsl */`
    // fragment shader code here
  `
};

const pointCloudExample = new PointCloudExample();
pointCloudExample.example(canvas, deviceType, shaderFiles);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `PointCloudExample` class?
- The `PointCloudExample` class is an example of how to create a point cloud using the PlayCanvas engine.

2. What are the input parameters of the `example` method?
- The `example` method takes in an HTML canvas element, a string representing the device type, and an object containing two strings representing the vertex and fragment shaders.

3. What does the `example` method do?
- The `example` method creates an application using the PlayCanvas engine, loads a 3D model, creates a camera entity, creates a new entity with a point cloud material, and updates the point cloud material based on time.
