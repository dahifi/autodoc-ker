The `MeshGenerationExample` class is a code example that demonstrates how to generate a 3D grid plane mesh and animate it using lights. The purpose of this code is to show how to create a mesh with dynamic vertex buffer and static index buffer, and how to update the mesh's vertex and index buffers each frame to animate the mesh.

The `example` method takes an HTML canvas element and a device type as input parameters. It creates a graphics device using the `createGraphicsDevice` method, initializes a new PlayCanvas application, and sets the canvas to fill the window and automatically change resolution to be the same as the canvas size. It then loads a texture asset and creates a list of component systems and resource handlers to be used by the application.

The method then creates four lights that will move in the scene and deform the mesh as well. It also creates a camera entity and positions it to look at the mesh. It generates positions and UV coordinates for vertices, stores them in Float32Arrays, and generates an array of indices to form a triangle list. It then creates a mesh with dynamic vertex buffer and static index buffer, and creates a material with a diffuse map and other properties.

The method sets an update function on the app's update event that moves the lights along circles and animates the mesh by updating its vertex buffer each frame. It evaluates the distance of each grid vertex to each light position, and increases the elevation of the vertex if the light is within range. It then stores the elevation in the .y element of the vertex position.

This code example can be used as a starting point for creating 3D grid plane meshes and animating them using lights. It demonstrates how to create a mesh with dynamic vertex buffer and static index buffer, and how to update the mesh's vertex and index buffers each frame to animate the mesh. It also shows how to create lights and a camera entity, and how to position them in the scene.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the MeshGenerationExample class?
- The MeshGenerationExample class is an example of how to generate a mesh in PlayCanvas engine and animate it using lights.

2. What graphics device options are being set in this code?
- The graphics device options being set in this code include the device type and the URLs for glslang and twgsl.

3. What is the role of the updateMesh function?
- The updateMesh function updates the positions and normals of the mesh each frame, and updates the UVs and indices only once as they do not change each frame. It also lets the mesh update the vertex and index buffer as needed.
