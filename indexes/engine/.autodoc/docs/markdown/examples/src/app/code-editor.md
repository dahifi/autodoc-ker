The `CodeEditor` component is a React component that provides a code editor interface for the PlayCanvas engine project. It imports the `MonacoEditor` component from the `@monaco-editor/react` package, which is a wrapper around the Monaco editor, a popular web-based code editor. It also imports several UI components from the `@playcanvas/pcui/react` package.

The component takes several props, including an array of `File` objects, which represent the files being edited, and several callback functions to handle changes to the files and linting errors. It also takes a boolean flag to indicate whether to use TypeScript or JavaScript.

The component renders a `Panel` component with a header of "CODE" and an ID of "codePane". The panel contains a menu bar with several buttons, including a play button, a language button, and a button to open the corresponding file on GitHub. The panel also contains a `Container` component with a tab bar that displays the names of the files being edited. The currently selected file is displayed in the `MonacoEditor` component below the tab bar.

The `CodeEditor` component uses the `useState` hook to keep track of the currently selected file. It also uses the `useEffect` hook to perform several side effects, including setting up event listeners for the panel toggle button and saving the panel's collapsed state to local storage.

The `CodeEditor` component uses the `MonacoEditor` component to render the code editor. It passes in the language of the currently selected file, the text of the currently selected file, and several callback functions to handle changes to the text and linting errors. It also sets several options for the editor, including the visibility of the horizontal scrollbar and the read-only state.

The `CodeEditor` component also includes several helper functions, including `beforeMount`, which adds the PlayCanvas type definitions to the TypeScript and JavaScript language services, and `selectFile`, which updates the currently selected file and highlights the corresponding tab.

Overall, the `CodeEditor` component provides a flexible and extensible code editor interface for the PlayCanvas engine project, allowing developers to edit and debug their code in a familiar and powerful environment.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `CodeEditor` component?
- The `CodeEditor` component is used to display and edit code files, with support for multiple files and different file types.

2. What is the role of the `beforeMount` function?
- The `beforeMount` function is called before the Monaco editor is mounted, and it adds the PlayCanvas type definitions to the TypeScript and JavaScript language defaults.

3. What is the purpose of the `onValidate` function?
- The `onValidate` function is called when the editor's contents are validated, and it checks if there are any linting errors. If there are no linting errors, it sets the `lintErrors` state to `false`, otherwise it sets it to `true`.
