The `GpuTimer` class is a utility class that provides a way to measure the time taken by the GPU to execute certain tasks. It is designed to work with the PlayCanvas engine and is used to profile the performance of the engine itself or any other application built on top of it.

The class constructor takes an instance of the `app` object, which is a reference to the PlayCanvas application. It initializes the WebGL context and the extension required for timer queries. It also creates a pool of free queries, a list of current frame queries, and a list of previous frame queries. The class also maintains two arrays of timings, one for the current frame and one for the previous frame.

The `begin` method is called at the beginning of each frame and takes a name parameter. It stores the previous frame's queries, checks if all in-flight queries have been invalidated, and resolves the previous frame timings. It then calls the `mark` method with the given name parameter.

The `mark` method takes a name parameter and is called to mark the beginning of a new query. It ends the previous query, allocates a new query, and begins it.

The `end` method is called at the end of each frame and ends the current query and adds the current frame queries to the list of previous frame queries.

The `_checkDisjoint` method checks if the GPU has been interrupted, thereby invalidating all in-flight queries. If it has, it returns all queries to the free list.

The `_allocateQuery` method either returns a previously freed query or allocates a new one if there aren't any.

The `_resolveFrameTimings` method attempts to resolve one frame's worth of timings. It waits for the last query in the frame to be available and then retrieves the timings for each query.

The `timings` getter returns an array of timings for the current frame.

Overall, the `GpuTimer` class provides a way to measure the performance of the GPU and can be used to optimize the performance of the PlayCanvas engine or any other application built on top of it. An example of how it can be used is to measure the time taken to render a particular scene and then optimize the rendering pipeline to reduce the time taken.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it relate to the PlayCanvas engine?
- This code defines a `GpuTimer` class that can be used to measure GPU timings for a PlayCanvas app. It is part of the PlayCanvas engine.

2. What events is the `GpuTimer` class listening for and how are they used?
- The `GpuTimer` class listens for the `frameupdate`, `framerender`, and `frameend` events of a PlayCanvas app. These events are used to mark the beginning and end of a frame, and to allocate and free GPU queries.

3. What is the significance of the `disjoint` variable in the `_checkDisjoint` method?
- The `disjoint` variable is used to check if the GPU has been interrupted, which can invalidate all in-flight queries. If `disjoint` is true, all queries are returned to the free list and the current frame and previous frames are discarded.
