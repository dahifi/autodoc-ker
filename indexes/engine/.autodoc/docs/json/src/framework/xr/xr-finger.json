  "summary": "The code defines a class called `XrFinger` which represents a finger in a hand. The class has private properties `_index`, `_hand`, `_joints`, and `_tip`. `_index` is a number representing the index of the finger, `_hand` is an instance of `XrHand` representing the hand that the finger belongs to, `_joints` is an array of `XrJoint` instances representing the joints in the finger, and `_tip` is an instance of `XrJoint` representing the tip of the finger.\n\nThe constructor of the class takes two arguments, `index` and `hand`, and initializes the `_index` and `_hand` properties with them. It also adds the instance of `XrFinger` to the `_fingers` array of the `_hand` instance.\n\nThe class has four getter methods, `index`, `hand`, `joints`, and `tip`, which return the values of the corresponding private properties. The `index` getter returns the index of the finger, the `hand` getter returns the instance of `XrHand` representing the hand that the finger belongs to, the `joints` getter returns an array of `XrJoint` instances representing the joints in the finger, and the `tip` getter returns an instance of `XrJoint` representing the tip of the finger.\n\nThis class is likely used in the larger project to represent fingers in a hand for use in XR (extended reality) applications. The `XrFinger` instances can be used to track the movement and position of fingers in a hand, which can be used for various purposes such as hand gestures and interactions with virtual objects. An example of how this class could be used is shown below:\n\n```\nconst hand = new XrHand();\nconst indexFinger = new XrFinger(1, hand);\nconst joints = indexFinger.joints;\nconst tip = indexFinger.tip;\n```\n\nIn this example, a new instance of `XrHand` is created, and then a new instance of `XrFinger` representing the index finger is created and added to the hand. The `joints` and `tip` properties of the `XrFinger` instance are then accessed and stored in variables for further use.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the XrFinger class?\n- The XrFinger class represents a finger with related joints and index.\n\n2. What are the parameters of the constructor function?\n- The constructor function takes in two parameters: index (number) and hand (XrHand).\n\n3. What is the purpose of the get tip() method?\n- The get tip() method returns the tip of a finger or null if not available."
