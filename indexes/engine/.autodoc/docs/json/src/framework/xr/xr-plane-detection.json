  "summary": "The code defines a class called `XrPlaneDetection` that provides the ability to detect real-world surfaces based on estimations of the underlying AR system. The class extends the `EventHandler` class and has several properties and methods that allow developers to interact with the plane detection system.\n\nThe `XrPlaneDetection` class has a constructor that takes a `manager` parameter, which is an instance of the `XrManager` class. The constructor sets up event listeners for the `end` event on the `manager` object. When the `end` event is fired, the `_onSessionEnd` method is called, which destroys all the detected planes and clears the `_planesIndex` map.\n\nThe `XrPlaneDetection` class has several events that can be listened to, including `available`, `unavailable`, `add`, and `remove`. The `available` event is fired when plane detection becomes available, and the `unavailable` event is fired when plane detection becomes unavailable. The `add` event is fired when a new plane is detected, and the `remove` event is fired when a plane is removed.\n\nThe `XrPlaneDetection` class has a `supported` property that returns `true` if plane detection is supported and `false` otherwise. It also has an `available` property that returns `true` if plane detection is available and `false` otherwise. The `planes` property returns an array of `XrPlane` instances that contain individual plane information, or `null` if plane detection is not available.\n\nThe `XrPlaneDetection` class has an `update` method that takes an `XRFrame` object as a parameter. The method updates the detected planes by iterating through the indexed planes and removing any planes that are no longer detected. It then iterates through the detected planes and creates new `XrPlane` instances for any planes that are not already indexed. If a plane is already indexed, it updates the existing `XrPlane` instance.\n\nThe `XrPlaneDetection` class can be used in conjunction with the `XrManager` class to start a session with plane detection enabled. For example:\n\n```javascript\napp.xr.start(camera, pc.XRTYPE_VR, pc.XRSPACE_LOCALFLOOR, {\n    planeDetection: true\n});\n```\n\nDevelopers can also listen to the `add` event to be notified when a new plane is detected. For example:\n\n```javascript\napp.xr.planeDetection.on('add', function (plane) {\n    // new plane is added\n});\n```\n\nOverall, the `XrPlaneDetection` class provides a way for developers to detect real-world surfaces in an AR environment and interact with the detected planes.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code provides the ability to detect real world surfaces based on estimations of the underlying AR system using Plane Detection.\n\n2. What events can be fired by XrPlaneDetection?\n- XrPlaneDetection can fire the 'available', 'unavailable', 'add', and 'remove' events.\n\n3. What is the structure of the XrPlaneDetection class?\n- The XrPlaneDetection class extends the EventHandler class and has private properties for the manager, supported, available, planesIndex, and planes. It also has methods for updating the planes, checking if plane detection is supported and available, and getting the planes."
