  "summary": "The code defines a class called `AnimSnapshot` which is used to store the state of an animation track at a particular time. This class is not meant to be used directly by developers, hence the `@ignore` tag in the JSDoc comment. \n\nThe constructor of the `AnimSnapshot` class takes an instance of the `AnimTrack` class as an argument. It initializes several properties of the `AnimSnapshot` instance, including the name of the snapshot, the time at which the snapshot was taken, and two arrays for caching input and output values of the animation curves. \n\nThe `AnimSnapshot` class pre-allocates input caches and storage for evaluation results. It loops through the input values of the `AnimTrack` instance and creates a new `AnimCache` instance for each input. It also loops through the curves and outputs of the `AnimTrack` instance and creates a new array to store the evaluation results for each curve. \n\nThe purpose of the `AnimSnapshot` class is to provide a way to efficiently store and retrieve the state of an animation track at a particular time. This is useful for implementing features such as animation blending and state machines, where multiple animations need to be combined or switched based on certain conditions. \n\nHere is an example of how the `AnimSnapshot` class might be used in the larger PlayCanvas engine project:\n\n```javascript\nconst animTrack = new AnimTrack('myAnimation');\nconst animSnapshot = new AnimSnapshot(animTrack);\n\n// update the animation track to a certain time\nanimTrack.update(0.5);\n\n// take a snapshot of the animation track at the current time\nconst snapshotTime = animTrack.getTime();\nconst snapshot = new AnimSnapshot(animTrack);\n\n// blend two snapshots together\nconst blendFactor = 0.5;\nconst blendedSnapshot = new AnimSnapshot(animTrack);\nfor (let i = 0; i < animTrack._curves.length; ++i) {\n    const curve = animTrack._curves[i];\n    const input = animTrack._inputs[curve._input];\n    const output = animTrack._outputs[curve._output];\n    const result = blendedSnapshot._results[i];\n    for (let j = 0; j < output._components; ++j) {\n        const valueA = snapshot._cache[curve._input].get(input[snapshotTime]);\n        const valueB = animSnapshot._cache[curve._input].get(input[animTrack._time]);\n        result[j] = valueA * (1 - blendFactor) + valueB * blendFactor;\n    }\n}\n``` \n\nIn this example, we create an `AnimTrack` instance for an animation called \"myAnimation\". We then create an `AnimSnapshot` instance for the animation track and update it to a certain time. We take a snapshot of the animation track at the current time and blend it with another snapshot using a blend factor. The resulting blended snapshot can then be used to update the animation track and play the blended animation.",

What is the `animTrack` parameter in the constructor used for?\n    \n    The `animTrack` parameter is used as the source track for the animation snapshot.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `AnimCache` class imported from `anim-cache.js`?\n    \n    The `AnimCache` class is used to store per-curve input cache for the animation snapshot."
