  "summary": "This code defines three constants that are used to specify the degree of freedom for movement in a 3D space. The constants are `MOTION_FREE`, `MOTION_LIMITED`, and `MOTION_LOCKED`. \n\n`MOTION_FREE` indicates that the degree of freedom has free movement, meaning that it can move in any direction without any restrictions. This is useful for objects that need to move freely in a 3D space, such as a camera or a player character.\n\n`MOTION_LIMITED` indicates that the degree of freedom has limited movement, meaning that it can only move within a certain range or along a certain axis. This is useful for objects that need to move within a specific area or along a specific path, such as a door or a moving platform.\n\n`MOTION_LOCKED` indicates that the degree of freedom is locked and cannot move at all. This is useful for objects that need to remain stationary, such as a wall or a floor.\n\nThese constants can be used throughout the PlayCanvas engine to specify the degree of freedom for movement in various components and systems. For example, in the physics system, these constants can be used to specify the type of joint between two rigid bodies. \n\n```javascript\n// Example usage in the physics system\nconst joint = new pc.PhysicalJoint();\njoint.setMotion(0, pc.MOTION_FREE); // Set the first degree of freedom to have free movement\njoint.setMotion(1, pc.MOTION_LIMITED); // Set the second degree of freedom to have limited movement\njoint.setMotion(2, pc.MOTION_LOCKED); // Set the third degree of freedom to be locked\n```\n\nOverall, this code provides a simple and standardized way to specify the degree of freedom for movement in a 3D space, making it easier to develop and maintain the PlayCanvas engine.",
  "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of this code?**\\\nA smart developer might ask what this code is used for and how it fits into the larger PlayCanvas engine project. This code defines three constants that represent different degrees of freedom for movement.\n    \n2. **What do the different constants represent?**\\\nA smart developer might ask for more information about what each of the three constants (`MOTION_FREE`, `MOTION_LIMITED`, and `MOTION_LOCKED`) actually mean and how they are used within the PlayCanvas engine. The code comments provide some information, but more context may be needed.\n    \n3. **Why are the constants marked with `@ignore`?**\\\nA smart developer might ask why the constants are marked with the `@ignore` JSDoc tag. This tag is typically used to indicate that a particular piece of code should be excluded from documentation generated by tools like JSDoc. The developer may want to know why these constants are excluded from documentation and whether there are any implications for using them in code."
