  "summary": "This code defines two constants that are used to specify different transition modes for buttons in the PlayCanvas engine. The first constant, `BUTTON_TRANSITION_MODE_TINT`, is used to specify different color tints for the hover, pressed, and inactive states of a button. The second constant, `BUTTON_TRANSITION_MODE_SPRITE_CHANGE`, is used to specify different sprites for the hover, pressed, and inactive states of a button.\n\nThese constants are likely used in conjunction with a button component in the PlayCanvas engine. The button component allows developers to create interactive buttons that respond to user input, such as clicks or touches. The transition mode of the button determines how the button changes appearance when it is interacted with.\n\nFor example, if a developer wants a button to change color when it is hovered over, they would set the transition mode to `BUTTON_TRANSITION_MODE_TINT` and specify the different tints for each state. They could do this using the `hoverTint`, `pressedTint`, and `inactiveTint` properties of the button component.\n\nSimilarly, if a developer wants a button to change its sprite when it is pressed, they would set the transition mode to `BUTTON_TRANSITION_MODE_SPRITE_CHANGE` and specify the different sprites for each state. They could do this using the `hoverSprite`, `pressedSprite`, and `inactiveSprite` properties of the button component.\n\nOverall, these constants provide a way for developers to customize the appearance of buttons in their PlayCanvas projects, making them more engaging and interactive for users.",
  "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of this code?**\\\nA smart developer might ask what this code is used for and how it fits into the PlayCanvas engine. This code defines constants for different transition modes for buttons in the engine.\n\n2. **What are the different transition modes available?**\\\nA smart developer might ask what the different transition modes are and how they differ. This code defines two transition modes: BUTTON_TRANSITION_MODE_TINT for color tints and BUTTON_TRANSITION_MODE_SPRITE_CHANGE for sprite changes.\n\n3. **How are these constants used in the PlayCanvas engine?**\\\nA smart developer might ask how these constants are used in the PlayCanvas engine and where they are referenced. Without further context, it is unclear how these constants are used in the engine."
