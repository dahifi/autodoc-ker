  "summary": "The code defines a class called `Component` that is used to attach functionality to an `Entity` in the PlayCanvas engine. The `Component` class extends the `EventHandler` class, which allows it to receive update events each frame and expose properties to the PlayCanvas Editor. \n\nThe `Component` class has two properties: `system` and `entity`. The `system` property is of type `ComponentSystem` and is used to create the `Component`. The `entity` property is of type `Entity` and is the `Entity` that the `Component` is attached to. \n\nThe `Component` class has a constructor that takes two parameters: `system` and `entity`. The constructor sets the `system` and `entity` properties of the `Component`. If the `system` has a `schema` property and the `_accessorsBuilt` property is not set, the `buildAccessors` method is called to create getter/setter pairs for each property defined in the `schema`. \n\nThe `Component` class has several methods that are used internally and are not meant to be called directly. The `onSetEnabled` method is called when the `enabled` property of the `Component` is set. If the `enabled` property changes from `false` to `true`, the `onEnable` method is called. If the `enabled` property changes from `true` to `false`, the `onDisable` method is called. The `onPostStateChange` method is called after the state of the `Component` has changed. \n\nThe `Component` class has a `data` property that allows direct access to the `Component` data. However, it is recommended to access the data properties via the individual properties as modifying the data directly will not fire 'set' events. \n\nOverall, the `Component` class is an important part of the PlayCanvas engine as it allows developers to attach functionality to `Entity` objects. The `Component` class is used extensively throughout the engine and is a crucial part of the engine's architecture. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```javascript\nimport { Component } from 'playcanvas';\n\nclass MyComponent extends Component {\n    constructor(system, entity) {\n        super(system, entity);\n\n        // set up component properties\n        this.enabled = true;\n        this.speed = 10;\n    }\n\n    onEnable() {\n        console.log('MyComponent enabled');\n    }\n\n    onDisable() {\n        console.log('MyComponent disabled');\n    }\n}\n\nexport { MyComponent };\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Component` class?\n    \n    The `Component` class is used to attach functionality to an `Entity`, and can receive update events each frame and expose properties to the PlayCanvas Editor.\n\n2. What is the `system` property used for?\n    \n    The `system` property is used to store the `ComponentSystem` that was used to create the `Component`.\n\n3. Why does the `buildAccessors` method check if `this._accessorsBuilt` is false before building accessors?\n    \n    The `buildAccessors` method checks if `this._accessorsBuilt` is false before building accessors to ensure that accessors are only built once for each `Component` instance."
