  "summary": "The code defines a class called `ParticleGPUUpdater` that wraps GPU particle render state and setup from `ParticleEmitter`. The purpose of this class is to update the GPU particle system with the latest emitter state and render the particles on the screen. \n\nThe class imports various math and graphics-related modules from the PlayCanvas engine. It also imports a function called `drawQuadWithShader` from `quad-render-utils.js` module. \n\nThe class constructor takes two arguments: `emitter` and `gd`. `emitter` is an instance of `ParticleEmitter` class, and `gd` is an instance of the PlayCanvas graphics device. \n\nThe class has several properties that are used to set the values of shader uniforms. These properties are Float32Array objects that hold the values of various emitter properties such as emitter position, emitter scale, spawn bounds, initial velocity, lifetime, etc. \n\nThe class has a method called `_setInputBounds()` that sets the values of `inBoundsSizeUniform` and `inBoundsCenterUniform` properties. These properties are used to calculate the size and center of the emitter's bounding box. \n\nThe class has a method called `randomize()` that sets the values of `frameRandomUniform` property to random values between 0 and 1. \n\nThe class has a method called `update()` that updates the GPU particle system with the latest emitter state. The method takes four arguments: `device`, `spawnMatrix`, `extentsInnerRatioUniform`, `delta`, and `isOnStop`. `device` is the PlayCanvas graphics device, `spawnMatrix` is the spawn matrix of the emitter, `extentsInnerRatioUniform` is the extents inner ratio of the emitter, `delta` is the time elapsed since the last update, and `isOnStop` is a boolean flag that indicates whether the emitter is stopped. \n\nThe method sets the blend state, depth state, and cull mode of the graphics device to default, no depth, and none, respectively. It then calls the `randomize()` method to set the values of `frameRandomUniform` property. \n\nThe method sets the values of various shader uniforms using the properties defined in the class. It then calls the `drawQuadWithShader()` function to render the particles on the screen. \n\nFinally, the method sets the values of `particleTexIN` and `particleTexOUT` parameters of the emitter's material to `texOUT` and `texIN`, respectively. It also sets the `beenReset` property of the emitter to false and swaps the values of `particleTexIN` and `particleTexOUT` properties of the emitter. \n\nIn summary, the `ParticleGPUUpdater` class is responsible for updating the GPU particle system with the latest emitter state and rendering the particles on the screen. It sets the values of various shader uniforms using the emitter properties and calls the `drawQuadWithShader()` function to render the particles.",
