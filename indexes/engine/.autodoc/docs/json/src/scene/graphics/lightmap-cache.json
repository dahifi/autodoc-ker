  "summary": "The code above defines a static class called `LightmapCache` that implements a cache of lightmaps generated at runtime using Lightmapper. The purpose of this class is to automatically release real-time baked lightmaps when mesh instances using them are destroyed. \n\nThe `LightmapCache` class uses a `RefCountedCache` class from the `../../core/ref-counted-cache.js` file to implement the cache. The `RefCountedCache` class is a utility class that keeps track of the number of references to an object and automatically destroys it when the reference count reaches zero. \n\nThe `LightmapCache` class has three static methods: `incRef`, `decRef`, and `destroy`. The `incRef` method adds a texture reference to the lightmap cache by calling the `incRef` method of the `RefCountedCache` class. The `decRef` method removes a texture reference from the lightmap cache by calling the `decRef` method of the `RefCountedCache` class. The `destroy` method destroys the cache by calling the `destroy` method of the `RefCountedCache` class. \n\nThis class can be used in the larger PlayCanvas engine project to manage the caching of lightmaps generated at runtime. Developers can use the `LightmapCache` class to automatically release real-time baked lightmaps when mesh instances using them are destroyed. This can help to optimize the performance of the engine by reducing memory usage and preventing memory leaks. \n\nHere is an example of how the `LightmapCache` class can be used in the PlayCanvas engine project:\n\n```\n// create a new lightmap texture\nconst lightmapTexture = new Texture();\n\n// add the texture to the lightmap cache\nLightmapCache.incRef(lightmapTexture);\n\n// use the texture in a mesh instance\nconst meshInstance = new MeshInstance(mesh, material);\nmeshInstance.lightmapTexture = lightmapTexture;\n\n// destroy the mesh instance\nmeshInstance.destroy();\n\n// remove the texture from the lightmap cache\nLightmapCache.decRef(lightmapTexture);\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `RefCountedCache` import?\n- The `RefCountedCache` import is used to implement the cache of lightmaps generated at runtime using Lightmapper.\n\n2. How does the `LightmapCache` class work?\n- The `LightmapCache` class is a pure static class that allows automatic release of realtime baked lightmaps when mesh instances using them are destroyed. It has methods to add and remove texture references from the lightmap cache.\n\n3. What is the significance of the `export { LightmapCache };` statement at the end of the code?\n- The `export { LightmapCache };` statement at the end of the code exports the `LightmapCache` class, making it available for use in other files/modules."
