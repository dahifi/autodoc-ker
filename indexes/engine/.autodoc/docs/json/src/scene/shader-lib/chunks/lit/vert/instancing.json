  "summary": "This code exports a GLSL shader code as a default module. The shader code defines four attributes, `instance_line1`, `instance_line2`, `instance_line3`, and `instance_line4`, each of which is a 4-component vector of floating-point values. These attributes are used to define the geometry of a 3D object in the PlayCanvas engine.\n\nThe `attribute` keyword in GLSL is used to define per-vertex data that is passed from the CPU to the GPU. In this case, the four attributes define the four lines that make up the edges of a 3D object. The `vec4` type specifies a 4-component vector, which is used to represent a point in 3D space along with an additional value (such as color or texture coordinates).\n\nThe purpose of this code is to provide a basic shader module that can be used as a starting point for defining the geometry of 3D objects in the PlayCanvas engine. By defining the four lines that make up the edges of an object, developers can create complex shapes and structures that can be rendered in real-time using WebGL.\n\nHere is an example of how this code might be used in a larger project:\n\n```javascript\nimport { Shader } from 'playcanvas';\n\nconst myShader = new Shader(device, {\n    attributes: {\n        instance_line1: { type: 'vec4' },\n        instance_line2: { type: 'vec4' },\n        instance_line3: { type: 'vec4' },\n        instance_line4: { type: 'vec4' }\n    },\n    vertexShader: /* glsl */`\n        attribute vec4 instance_line1;\n        attribute vec4 instance_line2;\n        attribute vec4 instance_line3;\n        attribute vec4 instance_line4;\n\n        void main() {\n            // Use the four attributes to define the geometry of the object\n            // ...\n        }\n    `,\n    fragmentShader: /* glsl */`\n        void main() {\n            // Define the color of the object\n            // ...\n        }\n    `\n});\n\n// Use the shader to render a 3D object\n// ...\n```\n\nIn this example, a new `Shader` object is created using the `instance_line1`, `instance_line2`, `instance_line3`, and `instance_line4` attributes. The `vertexShader` function uses these attributes to define the geometry of the object, while the `fragmentShader` function defines the color of the object. The resulting shader can then be used to render a 3D object in the PlayCanvas engine.",
  "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of this code?**\\\nThis code exports a GLSL shader code as a default module. It defines four attributes for a 2D shape instance's four lines.\n\n2. **What are the data types of the attributes defined in this code?**\\\nThe attributes defined in this code are all of type `vec4`, which represents a 4-component vector in GLSL.\n\n3. **Where is this code used in the PlayCanvas engine?**\\\nWithout additional context, it is unclear where this code is used in the PlayCanvas engine. It could potentially be used in a variety of places, such as rendering 2D shapes or defining custom materials."
