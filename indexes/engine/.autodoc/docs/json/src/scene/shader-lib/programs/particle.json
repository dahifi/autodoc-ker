  "summary": "The code defines a module called `particle` that contains a set of functions for creating and generating shader definitions for particle effects. The `createShaderDefinition` function takes in a device object and an options object, and returns a shader definition object that can be used to create a shader program for rendering particles.\n\nThe `createShaderDefinition` function first defines the vertex shader code by concatenating various shader chunks based on the options passed in. The function checks for options such as `mesh`, `localSpace`, `screenSpace`, `animTex`, `wrap`, `alignToMotion`, `normal`, and `stretch`, and adds the appropriate shader chunks to the vertex shader code. The function also checks if the `useCpu` option is set, and adds the appropriate shader chunks for CPU-based particle simulation.\n\nThe function then defines the fragment shader code by concatenating various shader chunks based on the options passed in. The function checks for options such as `gamma`, `toneMap`, `fog`, `normal`, `halflambert`, and `blend`, and adds the appropriate shader chunks to the fragment shader code.\n\nFinally, the function returns a shader definition object that contains the vertex and fragment shader code, which can be used to create a shader program for rendering particles.\n\nThe `generateKey` function generates a unique key for a set of particle options, which can be used to cache the shader definition object for faster shader creation.\n\nThe `_animTex` function generates the vertex shader code for animating particle textures based on the `animTexLoop` option.\n\nOverall, this module provides a flexible and customizable way to create and generate shader definitions for particle effects in the PlayCanvas engine. Developers can use this module to create custom particle effects with various options and settings.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `generateKey` function?\n- The `generateKey` function generates a unique key for a particle based on its options.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `createShaderDefinition` function?\n- The `createShaderDefinition` function creates a shader definition for rendering particles based on their options.\n\n3. What are the different blend modes supported by this code?\n- The different blend modes supported by this code are `BLEND_NORMAL`, `BLEND_ADDITIVE`, and `BLEND_MULTIPLICATIVE`."
