  "summary": "This code is a GLSL shader function that calculates the specular occlusion of a material. The function takes in several parameters, including the glossiness of the material, the ambient occlusion (AO) value, the world normal vector, and the view direction vector. \n\nThe first step of the function is to calculate the specular power using the glossiness value. This is done by raising 2 to the power of the glossiness multiplied by 11.0. The result is used to approximate the specular occlusion of the material.\n\nNext, the function calculates the specular occlusion using the world normal and view direction vectors, as well as the AO value. This is done by taking the dot product of the world normal and view direction vectors, adding the AO value, and raising the result to the power of 0.01 times the specular power. The result is then saturated and subtracted from 1.0 plus the AO value. The final result is then mixed with 1.0 using the material_occludeSpecularIntensity uniform value.\n\nFinally, the function applies the specular occlusion to the dSpecularLight and dReflection variables, which are used for directional light and reflection calculations, respectively. If the LIT_SHEEN flag is defined, the function also applies the specular occlusion to the sSpecularLight and sReflection variables, which are used for sheen calculations.\n\nOverall, this function is an important part of the PlayCanvas engine's shader system, as it allows for accurate and efficient calculation of specular occlusion in materials. It can be used in conjunction with other shader functions to create realistic lighting and shading effects in 3D scenes. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```glsl\nuniform float glossiness;\nuniform float ambientOcclusion;\nuniform vec3 worldNormal;\nuniform vec3 viewDirection;\n\nvoid main() {\n  occludeSpecular(glossiness, ambientOcclusion, worldNormal, viewDirection);\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What does the `material_occludeSpecularIntensity` uniform do?\n    \n    The `material_occludeSpecularIntensity` uniform controls the intensity of the specular occlusion effect applied to the material.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `occludeSpecular` function?\n    \n    The `occludeSpecular` function calculates an approximated specular occlusion value based on the gloss, ambient occlusion, world normal, and view direction of a material. It then applies this value to the diffuse and specular light and reflection calculations.\n\n3. What is the source of the formula used in the `occludeSpecular` function?\n    \n    The formula used in the `occludeSpecular` function is based on a presentation by Tri-Ace on real-time physically based rendering implementation."
