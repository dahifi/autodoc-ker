  "summary": "This code is a GLSL shader code that defines a float variable called `animFrame`. The purpose of this code is to calculate the current frame of an animation based on the texture coordinates and animation parameters provided. \n\nThe `texCoordsAlphaLife` variable is a vec4 that contains the texture coordinates (x and y) and alpha and life values (z and w) for a given pixel. The `animTexParams` variable is a vec3 that contains the animation parameters, specifically the starting frame (x), the number of frames per row (y), and the total number of frames (z) in the animation texture. \n\nThe `floor` function is used to round down the result of multiplying the texture coordinate's y value by the number of frames per row. This gives us the row of the current frame in the animation texture. We then add the starting frame value to this result to get the current frame number. \n\nThe `min` function is used to ensure that the current frame number does not exceed the total number of frames in the animation texture. This is important because if the current frame number exceeds the total number of frames, the animation will loop back to the beginning. \n\nOverall, this code is used to calculate the current frame of an animation in a GLSL shader. It can be used in conjunction with other shader code to create complex animations and effects in the PlayCanvas engine. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```glsl\nuniform sampler2D animationTexture;\nvarying vec4 texCoordsAlphaLife;\n\n// Define animTexParams vec3 here\n\nfloat animFrame = min(floor(texCoordsAlphaLife.w * animTexParams.y) + animTexParams.x, animTexParams.z);\nvec2 animTexCoords = vec2((animFrame + 0.5) / animTexParams.y, 0.5);\n\nvec4 animationColor = texture2D(animationTexture, animTexCoords);\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `texCoordsAlphaLife` variable in this code?\n   - The `texCoordsAlphaLife` variable is used to calculate the `animFrame` value, which is used for animation.\n\n2. What do the values of `animTexParams` represent?\n   - `animTexParams` is an array of three values, where the first value represents the starting frame of the animation, the second value represents the number of frames per row in the animation texture, and the third value represents the total number of frames in the animation texture.\n\n3. What is the data type of the `animFrame` variable?\n   - The `animFrame` variable is of type `float`."
