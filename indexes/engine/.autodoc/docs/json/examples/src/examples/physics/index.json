  "summary": "The code above is a module that exports several examples from the PlayCanvas engine project. The purpose of this code is to provide developers with examples of how to use different features of the engine. \n\nThe `import` statements at the beginning of the code import different example files from the project. These files contain code that demonstrates how to use specific features of the engine. For example, the `CompoundCollisionExample` file demonstrates how to use compound collision shapes, while the `VehicleExample` file demonstrates how to create a vehicle using the engine.\n\nThe `export` statement at the end of the code exports these example files as named exports. This means that other modules in the project can import these examples and use them in their own code. For example, a developer working on a game that uses the PlayCanvas engine could import the `VehicleExample` and use it as a starting point for creating their own vehicle.\n\nHere is an example of how a developer might use the `VehicleExample`:\n\n```\nimport { VehicleExample } from \"playcanvas-examples\";\n\n// Create a new instance of the VehicleExample\nconst vehicle = new VehicleExample();\n\n// Add the vehicle to the scene\napp.root.addChild(vehicle.entity);\n\n// Update the vehicle every frame\napp.on(\"update\", function (deltaTime) {\n    vehicle.update(deltaTime);\n});\n```\n\nIn summary, this code provides developers with examples of how to use different features of the PlayCanvas engine. These examples can be imported and used in other modules in the project.",
  "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of this code file?**\\\nThis code file exports several examples from the PlayCanvas engine related to compound collision, offset collision, falling shapes, raycasting, and vehicle simulation.\n\n2. **Where are the actual implementations of these examples located?**\\\nThe code file imports the examples from separate files located in the same directory, such as `compound-collision.js` and `falling-shapes.js`.\n\n3. **How can a developer use these examples in their own project?**\\\nA developer can import the desired example(s) from this code file into their own project using the `import` statement, such as `import { CompoundCollisionExample } from \"playcanvas-engine/examples\";`. They can then use the example code as a reference or starting point for their own implementation."
