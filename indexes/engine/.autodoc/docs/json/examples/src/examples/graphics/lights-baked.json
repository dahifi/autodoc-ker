  "summary": "The `LightsBakedExample` class is a code example that demonstrates how to use the PlayCanvas engine to create a scene with baked lighting. The purpose of this code is to show how to create entities with different types of render components, add lights to the scene, and bake lightmaps to improve performance.\n\nThe `example` method takes an HTML canvas element and a device type as parameters. It creates a graphics device using the `pc.createGraphicsDevice` method and initializes a new PlayCanvas application using the `pc.AppBase` constructor. It then sets the canvas to fill the window and automatically change resolution to be the same as the canvas size.\n\nThe code creates a material used on the geometry and an array of all render component primitive shape types. It then creates 40 entities with random shapes and positions, each with a render component that is set up to be lightmapped with baked direct lighting. It also creates a ground entity with a plane render component and adds a directional light and an omni light to the scene, both configured as baked lights.\n\nThe code sets the lightmap baking properties, including the lightmap mode, maximum resolution, and size multiplier. It then bakes the lightmaps using the `app.lightmapper.bake` method. Finally, it sets an update function on the app's update event to orbit the camera around the scene.\n\nThis code example can be used as a starting point for creating a PlayCanvas application with baked lighting. Developers can modify the code to add their own entities, lights, and materials, and adjust the lightmap baking properties to optimize performance. The `LightsBakedExample` class can be imported and used in other PlayCanvas projects to quickly set up a scene with baked lighting.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code is an example of how to use the PlayCanvas engine to create a scene with baked lighting.\n\n2. What graphics device options are being set?\n- The graphics device options being set include the device type, glslang URL, and twgsl URL.\n\n3. What types of entities are being created in the scene?\n- The scene includes entities with render components of various primitive shapes, a ground plane, a directional light, an omni light, and a camera."
