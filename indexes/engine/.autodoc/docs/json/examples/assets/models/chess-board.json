  "summary": "This code is not a part of the PlayCanvas engine project, but rather provides information about a 3D model called \"Chess Board\". The code includes details about the model's title, source, author, and license type. It also provides requirements for using the model, including the need to credit the author and the allowance for commercial use.\n\nThe purpose of this code is to provide clear and concise information about the 3D model for anyone who wants to use it in their project. By including the model's license type and requirements, users can ensure that they are using the model in a legal and ethical manner. Additionally, the code provides a credit that users can copy and paste when sharing their project to give proper attribution to the model's author.\n\nHere is an example of how this code might be used in a larger project:\n\nSuppose a game developer wants to use the \"Chess Board\" model in their chess game. They would first need to download the model from the source provided in the code. Then, they would need to include the code in their project to provide information about the model's license and requirements. Finally, they would need to copy and paste the credit provided in the code wherever they share their game to give proper attribution to the model's author.\n\nOverall, this code serves an important role in ensuring that 3D models are used in a legal and ethical manner. By providing clear and concise information about the model's license and requirements, users can avoid any legal issues and give proper credit to the model's author.",
