  "summary": "This code is not a part of the PlayCanvas engine project, but rather a comment providing information about the source of a 3D model used in the project. The comment provides a link to the Sketchfab website where the batmobile-armoured model can be obtained, as well as information about the Creative Commons license under which it is distributed.\n\nThis information is important for anyone working on the PlayCanvas engine project who may need to use or modify the batmobile-armoured model. By providing the source and licensing information, the comment ensures that the project is in compliance with the terms of the Creative Commons license and that proper attribution is given to the original creator of the model.\n\nWhile this code does not contain any actual programming logic, it is still an important part of the project documentation. It serves as a reminder to developers to always be mindful of licensing and attribution when using third-party assets in their projects. \n\nExample usage:\n\n// Import the batmobile-armoured model into the PlayCanvas engine project\nconst batmobile = app.assets.find(\"batmobile-armoured\");\nconst batmobileEntity = new pc.Entity();\nbatmobileEntity.addComponent(\"model\", {\n    type: \"asset\",\n    asset: batmobile\n});\napp.root.addChild(batmobileEntity);",
