  "summary": "The code in this file is responsible for creating a TCP server that listens for incoming connections and handles them using a set of predefined handlers. The server is designed to be used as part of a larger microservices architecture, where each microservice can register its own set of handlers with the server.\n\nThe `MicroAgentServer` class is the main entry point for the server. It creates a new instance of a `TCPServer` object and sets up a callback function to handle incoming connections. The `handle_connection` function is responsible for parsing incoming data and dispatching it to the appropriate handler.\n\nHandlers are registered with the server using the `register_handler` method. This method takes a handler object that implements a `handle_request` method. When a request comes in, the server will call the `handle_request` method on the appropriate handler.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the `MicroAgentServer` class to create a simple echo server:\n\n```python\nfrom micro_agent import MicroAgentServer\n\nclass EchoHandler:\n    def handle_request(self, request):\n        return request\n\nserver = MicroAgentServer()\nserver.register_handler(EchoHandler())\nserver.start()\n```\n\nIn this example, we create a new `EchoHandler` object that simply returns the request data. We then register this handler with the server and start it up. Now, any data sent to the server will be echoed back to the client.\n\nOverall, this code provides a simple and flexible way to handle incoming TCP connections in a microservices architecture. By allowing each microservice to register its own set of handlers, the server can be easily customized to handle a wide variety of requests.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `MicroAgent` class?\n   \n   The `MicroAgent` class appears to be a base class for creating agents that can perform various tasks. It contains methods for registering and unregistering agents, as well as a method for sending messages between agents.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `register_agent` method?\n   \n   The `register_agent` method is used to add a new agent to the list of registered agents. This allows the agent to receive messages and participate in the system.\n\n3. How are messages sent between agents?\n   \n   Messages are sent between agents using the `send_message` method. This method takes the name of the recipient agent and the message to be sent as arguments, and then sends the message to the recipient agent's `receive_message` method."
