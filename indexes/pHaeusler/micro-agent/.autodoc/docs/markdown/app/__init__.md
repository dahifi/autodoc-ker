The code in this file is responsible for creating a TCP server that listens for incoming connections and handles them using a set of predefined handlers. The server is designed to be used as a microservice agent that can communicate with other microservices in a larger project.

The `MicroAgentServer` class is the main entry point for the server. It creates a TCP server socket and listens for incoming connections. When a connection is established, it creates a new thread to handle the connection and passes it to the `ConnectionHandler` class.

The `ConnectionHandler` class is responsible for handling the incoming connection. It reads the data from the socket and passes it to the `RequestHandler` class to process the request. The `RequestHandler` class is responsible for parsing the request and invoking the appropriate handler based on the request type.

The handlers are defined in the `handlers` module. Each handler is a function that takes a request object as input and returns a response object. The request object contains the data sent by the client, while the response object contains the data to be sent back to the client.

Here is an example of how to use the `MicroAgentServer` class:

```python
from micro_agent import MicroAgentServer
from micro_agent.handlers import ping_handler, echo_handler

server = MicroAgentServer()
server.add_handler('ping', ping_handler)
server.add_handler('echo', echo_handler)
server.start()
```

This code creates a new `MicroAgentServer` instance, adds two handlers (`ping` and `echo`), and starts the server. The `ping_handler` simply returns a response with the string "pong", while the `echo_handler` returns a response with the same data sent by the client.

Overall, this code provides a simple and flexible way to create a microservice agent that can communicate with other microservices in a larger project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `MicroAgent` class?
   - The `MicroAgent` class is a base class for creating micro-agents that can perform various tasks and communicate with other agents.
2. What is the significance of the `@abstractmethod` decorator on the `run` method?
   - The `@abstractmethod` decorator indicates that any subclass of `MicroAgent` must implement a `run` method, which is the main method that defines the behavior of the agent.
3. What is the purpose of the `AgentRegistry` class?
   - The `AgentRegistry` class is a singleton class that maintains a registry of all the micro-agents in the system, allowing for easy communication and coordination between agents.
