The code defines two classes, `RCE` and `NRCE`, which are used to compute the relative cross entropy (RCE) and normalized RCE (NRCE) metrics, respectively. These metrics are used to evaluate models that predict the probability of success (e.g., click-through rate) and compare them to a reference straw man model. 

The `RCE` class computes the RCE metric, which is the binary cross entropy of the model compared to the straw man model. The straw man model is a constant predictor that always predicts the average over the labels. The RCE metric is defined as `100 * (CE(reference model) - CE(model)) / CE(reference model)`, where CE is the cross entropy of the model. The higher the RCE, the better the model is performing compared to the straw man model. The `NRCE` class computes the NRCE metric, which is the RCE of the normalized model. The normalized model prediction is the product of the model prediction and the ratio of the average label to the average model prediction. The NRCE metric is used to measure how well the model would perform if it were well calibrated. 

Both classes inherit from the `torchmetrics.Metric` class and implement the `update`, `compute`, and `reset` methods. The `update` method updates the metric with the predicted values and ground truth labels for a batch of examples. The `compute` method computes the accumulated metric over all examples seen so far. The `reset` method resets the metric to its initial state. 

The `RCE` class uses the `_binary_cross_entropy_with_clipping` function to compute the binary cross entropy with clipping. The function clips the predictions to lie in the range `[epsilon, 1-epsilon]` to keep the log function stable. The `NRCE` class overrides the `update` method to compute the normalized model prediction and uses the `sigmoid` function to convert logits to probabilities if `from_logits` is True. 

The classes take several arguments, including `from_logits`, `label_smoothing`, and `epsilon`. The `from_logits` argument specifies whether the predictions are logits or probabilities. The `label_smoothing` argument is a smoothing constant used to smooth the ground truth labels. The `epsilon` argument is a small constant used to clip the predictions. 

Overall, these classes provide a way to evaluate the performance of models that predict the probability of success and compare them to a reference straw man model. The RCE and NRCE metrics can be used to measure how well the model is performing and how well it is calibrated, respectively.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the RCE and NRCE metrics?
- The RCE metric is used to compute the relative cross entropy of a model compared to a reference straw man model, while the NRCE metric calculates the RCE of the normalized model where the prediction average is normalized to the average label seen so far.
2. What is the difference between `from_logits` and `label_smoothing` parameters?
- The `from_logits` parameter specifies whether the predictions are logits or probabilities, while the `label_smoothing` parameter is a smoothing constant used to smooth the given values.
3. What is the purpose of the `_binary_cross_entropy_with_clipping` function?
- The `_binary_cross_entropy_with_clipping` function is used to clip predictions and apply binary cross entropy to match the implementation in Keras.
