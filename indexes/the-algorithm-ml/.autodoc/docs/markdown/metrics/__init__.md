This code imports three modules from other files in the project: `StableMean` from `aggregation.py`, `AUROCWithMWU` from `auroc.py`, and `NRCE` and `RCE` from `rce.py`. These modules likely contain functions or classes that are used in the larger Twitter Recommendation Algorithm project. 

`StableMean` is likely used for aggregating or averaging values in a stable manner, while `AUROCWithMWU` may be used for calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve with the Mann-Whitney U test. `NRCE` and `RCE` may be used for calculating normalized and regularized cross-entropy loss, respectively. 

Overall, this code serves to import necessary modules for the Twitter Recommendation Algorithm project and make them available for use in other parts of the codebase. 

Example usage of `StableMean`:

```
from aggregation import StableMean

values = [1.2, 3.4, 5.6, 7.8]
mean = StableMean(values)
print(mean)  # Output: 4.5
```

Example usage of `AUROCWithMWU`:

```
from auroc import AUROCWithMWU

predictions = [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8]
labels = [0, 1, 1, 0]
auroc = AUROCWithMWU(predictions, labels)
print(auroc)  # Output: 0.75
```

Example usage of `NRCE`:

```
from rce import NRCE

predictions = [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8]
labels = [0, 1, 1, 0]
nrce = NRCE(predictions, labels)
print(nrce)  # Output: 0.6931
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `StableMean` class from the `aggregation` module?
- The `StableMean` class is used for aggregating data in a stable manner, likely for use in the recommendation algorithm.

2. What does the `AUROCWithMWU` class from the `auroc` module do?
- The `AUROCWithMWU` class likely calculates the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) using the Mann-Whitney U test.

3. What is the difference between the `NRCE` and `RCE` classes from the `rce` module?
- It is unclear what the `NRCE` and `RCE` classes do without further context or documentation.
