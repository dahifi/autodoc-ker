The code above defines a function called `load_config_from_yaml` that loads a configuration file in YAML format and parses it into a Python object. The function takes two arguments: `config_type`, which is the type of the configuration object to be returned, and `yaml_path`, which is the path to the YAML file to be loaded.

The function first defines a nested function called `_substitute` that replaces environment variables and the current user's name in a string using Python's `string.Template` class. This is done to allow for dynamic substitution of values in the configuration file.

The function then opens the YAML file specified by `yaml_path` and reads its contents into a string variable called `raw_contents`. It then uses the `yaml.safe_load` method to parse the YAML contents into a Python object. The `_substitute` function is called on the raw contents before parsing to allow for dynamic substitution of values.

Finally, the function returns the parsed object, which is an instance of the `config_type` class.

This function is likely used in the larger project to load and parse configuration files for the Twitter Recommendation Algorithm - Heavy Ranker and TwHIN embeddings. By using YAML files for configuration, the project can easily modify and update its parameters without having to modify the code itself. The function also allows for dynamic substitution of values, which can be useful for specifying file paths, usernames, and other variables that may change depending on the environment in which the code is run.

Example usage:

```
from tml.core.config.base_config import BaseConfig

class MyConfig(BaseConfig):
    param1: str
    param2: int

config = load_config_from_yaml(MyConfig, "/path/to/config.yaml")
print(config.param1)
print(config.param2)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `load_config_from_yaml` function?
- The function is used to load a config file (in yaml format) and parse it, returning an object of the specified `config_type`.

2. What is the significance of the `_substitute` function within `load_config_from_yaml`?
- The `_substitute` function is used to substitute environment variables and the current user's name into the contents of the yaml file.

3. What is the reason for using the `Type` and `BaseConfig` types in the function signature?
- The `Type` type is used to specify the type of the `config_type` parameter, which is expected to be a subclass of `BaseConfig`. This allows for type checking and validation of the config object.
