This code is a command-line interface (CLI) tool that allows the user to fetch various properties of the current environment. The environment is defined in the `tml.machines.environment` module, which is imported at the beginning of the code. The purpose of this tool is to provide an easy way to access environment properties for debugging and troubleshooting purposes.

The tool takes a single command-line argument `--property`, which specifies which property of the environment to fetch. Depending on the value of this argument, the tool prints the corresponding property value to the console. For example, if the user runs the tool with `--property=using_dds`, the tool will print whether the current environment is using DDS (Data Distribution Service) or not.

The tool supports several other properties, such as `has_readers`, `get_task_type`, `is_datasetworker`, etc. Each property corresponds to a method in the `tml.machines.environment` module, which is called by the tool to fetch the property value.

This tool can be used in the larger project to quickly check the environment properties and diagnose any issues related to the environment. For example, if the project is running on a distributed system with multiple nodes, the tool can be used to check whether all nodes are using DDS or not, and whether they are correctly configured to communicate with each other. The tool can also be used to check the task type of the current node, which can be useful for load balancing and resource allocation purposes.

Here is an example of how to use this tool:

```
python environment_tool.py --property=using_dds
```

This will print `True` or `False` depending on whether the current environment is using DDS or not.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is used to fetch various properties of the current environment, such as whether the environment is using DDS, whether it has readers, and what type of task it is.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code depends on the `tml.machines.environment` module and the `absl` library, which are both imported at the beginning of the code.

3. What is the expected output of this code?
- The expected output of this code depends on the value of the `property` flag that is passed in when running the code. For example, if the `property` flag is set to "using_dds", the output will be a boolean indicating whether the environment is using DDS. If the `property` flag is set to "get_task_type", the output will be a string indicating the type of task being performed in the environment.
