The code defines a class called `ModelAndLoss` which is a wrapper around a PyTorch model and a loss function. The purpose of this class is to provide a unified interface for training and evaluating the model. 

The `__init__` method takes in the following arguments:
- `model`: the PyTorch model to be wrapped
- `loss_fn`: the loss function to be used for training and evaluation
- `stratifiers`: a list of `StratifierConfig` objects that define discrete features to be used for stratification during evaluation

The `forward` method takes in a `RecapBatch` object and runs the model forward pass on the input batch. It then calculates the loss using the provided loss function. If `stratifiers` are provided, it adds them to the output dictionary for use in stratified evaluation. Finally, it returns the loss and a dictionary of outputs that includes the model predictions, the loss, and any additional information that may be useful for evaluation.

This class is likely used in the larger project for training and evaluating the recommendation algorithm. It provides a convenient interface for handling the model and loss function, and allows for easy customization of the evaluation process through the use of `stratifiers`. 

Example usage:
```python
from my_model import MyModel
from my_loss import MyLoss
from typing import List
from tml.projects.home.recap.embedding import config as embedding_config_mod
from my_dataset import RecapBatch

# create model and loss function
model = MyModel()
loss_fn = MyLoss()

# create list of stratifiers
stratifiers = [
  embedding_config_mod.StratifierConfig(name="age", index=0),
  embedding_config_mod.StratifierConfig(name="gender", index=1)
]

# create ModelAndLoss object
model_and_loss = ModelAndLoss(model=model, loss_fn=loss_fn, stratifiers=stratifiers)

# run forward pass on input batch
batch = RecapBatch(...)
loss, outputs = model_and_loss(batch)

# access model predictions and other outputs
predictions = outputs["logits"]
labels = outputs["labels"]
weights = outputs["weights"]
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a PyTorch module for a recommendation algorithm that wraps a given model and loss function, and includes functionality for stratification of metrics.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `forward` method?
- The `forward` method takes in a `RecapBatch` object containing various features and embeddings, and returns a tuple of the calculated losses and a dictionary of outputs and additional information.

3. What is the significance of the `stratifiers` argument in the `ModelAndLoss` constructor?
- The `stratifiers` argument is an optional list of `StratifierConfig` objects that specify which discrete features to emit for metrics stratification. If provided, the `forward` method will add these stratifiers to the output dictionary.
