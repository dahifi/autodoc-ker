  "summary": "This code defines a set of common metrics that can be used to evaluate the performance of multi-task models. The metrics are implemented as classes that inherit from various classes in the `torchmetrics` library, as well as from several custom mixins that provide additional functionality. \n\nThe `probs_and_labels` function takes a dictionary of outputs from a model and a task index, and returns a dictionary containing the predicted probabilities and labels for that task. This function is used by several of the metric classes to extract the relevant information from the model outputs.\n\nThe `Count`, `Ctr`, and `Pctr` classes implement simple metrics for counting the number of samples, the mean of the labels, and the mean of the predicted probabilities, respectively. These metrics are useful for evaluating binary classification tasks.\n\nThe `Precision`, `Recall`, and `TorchMetricsRocauc` classes implement more complex metrics for evaluating binary classification tasks, including precision, recall, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). These metrics take into account both the predicted probabilities and the true labels for each sample.\n\nThe `Auc`, `PosRanks`, `ReciprocalRank`, and `HitAtK` classes implement additional metrics for evaluating ranking tasks, such as link prediction in graphs. These metrics are based on the ranks of the positive samples relative to the negative samples, and include the area under the precision-recall curve, the mean rank of the positive samples, the reciprocal of the mean rank of the positive samples, and the fraction of positive samples that rank in the top K among their negatives.\n\nOverall, these metrics provide a comprehensive set of tools for evaluating the performance of multi-task models on a variety of tasks, including binary classification and ranking. They can be used in conjunction with the `tml` library to train and evaluate models in a standardized way. For example, to evaluate a model on precision and recall for task 0, one could use the following code:\n\n```\nfrom tml.core.metric_mixin import MetricMixin\nfrom tml.torch.metrics import Precision, Recall\n\nmetrics = MetricMixin()\nmetrics.add_metric(Precision(task_idx=0))\nmetrics.add_metric(Recall(task_idx=0))\n\noutputs = model(inputs)\nresults = metrics(outputs)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines several common metrics that support multi-task models, including Count, Ctr, Pctr, Precision, Recall, TorchMetricsRocauc, Auc, PosRanks, ReciprocalRank, and HitAtK.\n\n2. What inputs does this code require?\n- The code requires a dictionary of outputs, which should include \"probabilities\" and \"labels\" keys, as well as a task index.\n\n3. What is the output of this code?\n- The output of this code is a dictionary with a \"value\" key that contains the calculated metric value. The specific metric calculated depends on which class is instantiated and called."
