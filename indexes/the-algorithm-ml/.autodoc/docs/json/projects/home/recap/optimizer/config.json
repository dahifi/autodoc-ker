  "summary": "This code defines optimization configurations for models in the Twitter's Recommendation Algorithm - Heavy Ranker and TwHIN embeddings project. The purpose of this code is to provide a way to configure the optimization process for different models in the project. \n\nThe code defines three classes: RecapAdamConfig, MultiTaskLearningRates, and RecapOptimizerConfig. RecapAdamConfig defines the configuration for the Adam optimizer, which is a popular optimization algorithm used in deep learning. It specifies the momentum term, exponential weighted decay factor, and numerical stability in the denominator. \n\nMultiTaskLearningRates defines the learning rates for different towers of the model and the backbone of the model. This is useful for models that have multiple tasks or sub-models that require different learning rates. \n\nRecapOptimizerConfig combines the configurations for the Adam optimizer and the learning rates for different tasks. It allows for the specification of multiple learning rates for different tasks or a single learning rate for a single task. \n\nThis code can be used in the larger project by importing these classes and using them to configure the optimization process for different models. For example, if a model has multiple tasks with different learning rate requirements, the MultiTaskLearningRates class can be used to specify the learning rates for each task. If a model has a single task, the single_task_learning_rate field in RecapOptimizerConfig can be used to specify the learning rate. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nfrom optimization_config import RecapOptimizerConfig, MultiTaskLearningRates, RecapAdamConfig\n\n# Define learning rates for different tasks\nlearning_rates = MultiTaskLearningRates(\n    tower_learning_rates={\n        \"task1\": 0.001,\n        \"task2\": 0.0001\n    },\n    backbone_learning_rate=0.0001\n)\n\n# Define optimizer configuration\noptimizer_config = RecapOptimizerConfig(\n    multi_task_learning_rates=learning_rates,\n    adam=RecapAdamConfig(beta_1=0.95, beta_2=0.999, epsilon=1e-8)\n)\n\n# Use optimizer configuration in model training\nmodel.train(optimizer_config=optimizer_config)\n```",
