Here is an example of how this license file can be used in the PlayCanvas engine project:

```javascript
// This code uses the PlayCanvas engine under the terms of the MIT License.

// Import the PlayCanvas engine module
import * as pc from 'playcanvas';

// Create a new PlayCanvas application
const app = new pc.Application();

// Add a new scene to the application
const scene = new pc.Scene();
app.scenes.add(scene);

// Create a new entity in the scene
const entity = new pc.Entity();
scene.addEntity(entity);

// Set the position of the entity
entity.setPosition(0, 0, 0);

// Run the application
app.start();
```
