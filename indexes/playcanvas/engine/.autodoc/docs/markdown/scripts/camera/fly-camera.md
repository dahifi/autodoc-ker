The `FlyCamera` script is a component of the PlayCanvas engine that allows the user to control the camera in a 3D scene. The script provides functionality for moving the camera in response to user input from the keyboard and mouse. 

The script has three attributes: `speed`, `fastSpeed`, and `mode`. `speed` and `fastSpeed` are numbers that determine the speed at which the camera moves. `mode` is an enum that determines the behavior of the camera when the user interacts with it. The `Lock` mode locks the camera's orientation and allows the user to move it around the scene. The `Drag` mode allows the user to drag the camera around the scene.

The `initialize` function sets up the initial state of the camera. It gets the current rotation of the camera and stores it in `ex` and `ey`. It also sets the `moved` and `lmbDown` flags to false. The function then disables the context menu and sets up event listeners for mouse movement, mouse button down, and mouse button up.

The `update` function is called every frame and updates the camera's position and orientation based on user input. It checks if the shift key is pressed and updates the speed accordingly. It then checks which keys are pressed and moves the camera in the appropriate direction.

The `onMouseMove` function is called when the user moves the mouse. It updates the camera's orientation based on the movement of the mouse. It checks if the `mode` is set to `Lock` and if the mouse pointer is locked. If it is not, the function returns. If the `mode` is set to `Drag` and the left mouse button is not down, the function returns. The function then updates the camera's orientation based on the movement of the mouse.

The `onMouseDown` function is called when the user presses a mouse button. If the left mouse button is pressed, it sets the `lmbDown` flag to true. If the `mode` is set to `Lock` and the mouse pointer is not locked, it enables pointer lock.

The `onMouseUp` function is called when the user releases a mouse button. If the left mouse button is released, it sets the `lmbDown` flag to false.

Overall, the `FlyCamera` script provides a way for the user to control the camera in a 3D scene. It allows the user to move the camera around the scene and change its orientation. The script can be used in any PlayCanvas project that requires camera control. An example of how to use the `FlyCamera` script can be seen below:

```javascript
// Create a new entity and add the FlyCamera script to it
var cameraEntity = new pc.Entity();
cameraEntity.addComponent('camera');
cameraEntity.addComponent('script');
cameraEntity.script.create('flyCamera');

// Add the entity to the scene
app.root.addChild(cameraEntity);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What does this code do?
- This code defines a script called `FlyCamera` that allows the user to control the position and orientation of a camera in a 3D scene using the keyboard and mouse.

2. What are the default values for the `speed`, `fastSpeed`, and `mode` attributes?
- The default value for `speed` is 10, the default value for `fastSpeed` is 20, and the default value for `mode` is 0 (which corresponds to the "Lock" option in the enum).

3. What events does the script listen for and how does it respond to them?
- The script listens for mouse move, mouse down, and mouse up events using the `app.mouse.on` method. It responds to these events by updating the camera's orientation and position based on the user's input.
