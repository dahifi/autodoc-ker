# PlayCanvas Engine: FxaaEffect

The `FxaaEffect` class is a post-processing effect that implements the Fast Approximate Anti-Aliasing (FXAA) algorithm by NVIDIA. This effect is used to smooth out jagged edges and improve the overall visual quality of the rendered scene. 

The `FxaaEffect` class extends the `PostEffect` class, which is a base class for all post-processing effects in the PlayCanvas engine. It takes a `GraphicsDevice` object as a parameter and creates a new instance of the post effect. 

The `FxaaEffect` class contains a shader that performs the FXAA algorithm. The shader takes a color buffer texture and the resolution of the screen as input, and outputs the final color of each pixel after applying the FXAA algorithm. The shader uses several techniques to smooth out jagged edges, such as edge detection, direction calculation, and color blending. 

The `FxaaEffect` class also contains a `render` method that takes an input target, an output target, and a rectangle as parameters. The method sets the resolution of the screen and the color buffer texture as uniforms in the shader, and then draws a quad using the shader to the output target. 

The `Fxaa` script is a wrapper around the `FxaaEffect` class that can be attached to a camera entity in the scene. The script initializes the `FxaaEffect` object and adds it to the post-effects queue of the camera. It also listens for changes in the state of the script and adds or removes the effect from the queue accordingly. 

Overall, the `FxaaEffect` class and the `Fxaa` script are essential components of the PlayCanvas engine's post-processing pipeline. They provide a simple and efficient way to apply the FXAA algorithm to the rendered scene and improve its visual quality. 

Example usage:

```javascript
var fxaaEffect = new FxaaEffect(graphicsDevice);
var fxaaScript = new Fxaa();
fxaaScript.effect = fxaaEffect;
cameraEntity.addComponent('script');
cameraEntity.script.create('fxaa');
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code implements the FXAA post effect by NVIDIA for the PlayCanvas engine.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `render` function?
- The `render` function takes in an `inputTarget` (the target to render the effect onto), an `outputTarget` (the target to output the result to), and a `rect` (the rectangle to render the effect within).
- The `render` function outputs the result of the effect to the `outputTarget`.

3. What is the `Fxaa` script used for?
- The `Fxaa` script is used to initialize the `FxaaEffect` and add it to the post effects queue of the entity's camera. It also handles enabling and disabling the effect based on the state of the entity.
