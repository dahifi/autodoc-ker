This code is not a part of the PlayCanvas engine project, but rather a description of modifications made to a 3D model of a house that will be used in the project. The purpose of this code is to provide information about the source of the house model, its licensing, and the modifications that have been made to it to make it suitable for use in the PlayCanvas engine.

The house model was obtained from Sketchfab, a platform for sharing and discovering 3D models. It is distributed under a Creative Commons license, which allows for the model to be used and modified as long as proper attribution is given. The modifications made to the model include generating a uv1 channel for lightmapping and stripping out the textures. Additionally, the model has been converted to the glb format, which is a binary file format for 3D models that is optimized for web and mobile applications.

This code is important for the PlayCanvas engine project because it provides information about the source and licensing of the house model, which is necessary for ensuring that the project is in compliance with copyright laws. It also provides information about the modifications made to the model, which is important for understanding how the model will be used in the project. For example, the fact that the textures have been stripped out means that the model will need to be textured using materials in the PlayCanvas engine.

Overall, this code serves as a documentation of the modifications made to the house model and is an important part of the PlayCanvas engine project.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of this code?**
    
    This code explains the modifications done to a house model obtained from a specific address, including the generation of a uv1 channel for lightmapping, stripping out textures, and converting it to glb format.

2. **What is the CC license mentioned in the code?**
    
    The CC license mentioned in the code is the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, under which the house model is distributed.

3. **What is the significance of generating a uv1 channel for lightmapping?**
    
    Generating a uv1 channel for lightmapping allows for more efficient and accurate lighting in the 3D model, as it provides a separate set of UV coordinates specifically for lightmap textures.
