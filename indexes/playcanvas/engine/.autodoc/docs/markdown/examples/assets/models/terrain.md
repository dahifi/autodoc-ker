This code is not a part of the PlayCanvas engine project, but rather a note about the source and modifications made to a 3D model used in the project.

This note serves as a record of the source and modifications made to the model, which may be important for legal and attribution purposes. It also provides context for the use of the model in the larger project, indicating that it is a terrain model and has been optimized for use in the PlayCanvas engine.
