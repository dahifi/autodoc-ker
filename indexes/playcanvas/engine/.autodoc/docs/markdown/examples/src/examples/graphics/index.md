This code exports a list of examples from various modules in the PlayCanvas engine. Each example is a separate module that demonstrates a specific feature or technique in the engine. These examples can be used as a reference for developers who want to learn how to use the engine or as a starting point for building their own projects.

For example, the "AreaLightsExample" module demonstrates how to use area lights in the engine, while the "MeshGenerationExample" module shows how to generate meshes programmatically. Each module is named after the feature it demonstrates, making it easy to find the relevant example.

Developers can import these examples into their own projects and modify them to suit their needs. For instance, they could use the "MaterialPhysicalExample" module as a starting point for creating their own physically-based materials.

Overall, this code serves as a valuable resource for developers who want to learn how to use the PlayCanvas engine and take advantage of its features.
