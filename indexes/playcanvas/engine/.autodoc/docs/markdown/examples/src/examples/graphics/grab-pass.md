The `GrabPassExample` class is a part of the PlayCanvas engine project and is responsible for rendering a scene with a refraction shader that distorts the view behind it. The class contains a static `example` method that takes a canvas element, a device type, and two shader files as input. The method creates a graphics device using the `createGraphicsDevice` method and initializes a new PlayCanvas application using the `AppBase` class. It then loads a list of assets, including a normal map, a roughness map, and a cubemap texture, and sets up the scene by creating a camera, a skydome, and several primitive shapes. 

The `example` method also creates a box primitive that uses the refraction shader to distort the view behind it. The shader is defined in the `shader.vert` and `shader.frag` files, which are passed as input to the method. The `shader.vert` file defines the vertex shader, which projects the position of the primitive and sets the texture coordinates. The `shader.frag` file defines the fragment shader, which samples the offset texture to add distortion to the sampled background, gets the normalized UV coordinates for the canvas, and calculates the mipmap level based on the roughness of the material. It then samples the background pixel color with distorted offset, tints the material based on the mipmap level, and brightens the refracted texture. 

The `example` method updates the scene each frame by rotating the primitives, orbiting the camera, and updating the refraction material. The method uses the `rotate` method to rotate the primitives and the `setLocalPosition` and `lookAt` methods to orbit the camera. The method also sets the `castShadows` and `receiveShadows` properties of the glass primitive to `false` to prevent it from casting or receiving shadows. 

Overall, the `GrabPassExample` class demonstrates how to use the PlayCanvas engine to create a scene with a refraction shader that distorts the view behind it. The class can be used as a starting point for creating more complex scenes with custom shaders and materials.
## Questions: 
 1. What does this code do?
- This code is an example implementation of a refraction shader using the PlayCanvas engine. It creates a scene with primitives and a glass object that distorts the view behind it.

2. What are the dependencies of this code?
- This code depends on the PlayCanvas engine and requires the following files: `shader.vert`, `shader.frag`, `normal-map.png`, `pc-gray.png`, and `helipad-env-atlas.png`.

3. What is the purpose of the `GrabPassExample` class?
- The `GrabPassExample` class is a container for the example implementation of the refraction shader. It defines the category, name, and files required for the example, and contains the `example` method that sets up the scene and runs the shader.
