The `XrPickingExample` class is a code example that demonstrates how to use the PlayCanvas engine to create a virtual reality (VR) experience. The code creates a grid of cubes and allows the user to pick and change the color of a cube by pointing at it with a VR controller. 

The `example` method is the main entry point of the code. It takes two parameters: a canvas element and a device type. The method creates a new PlayCanvas application and sets up the canvas to fill the window. It also creates a camera and a light entity and adds them to the scene. The `createCube` function is used to create a grid of cubes and add them to the scene. 

The code checks if the browser supports WebXR and if so, it sets up event listeners for mouse and touch input to activate VR mode. When the user enters VR mode, the code listens for input events from the VR controller and uses a raycasting technique to determine which cube the user is pointing at. If a cube is selected, its color is randomized. The code also renders a line to represent the input source ray of the VR controller.

If the browser does not support WebXR, the code displays a message to the user indicating that the feature is not supported.

This code example can be used as a starting point for developers who want to create VR experiences using the PlayCanvas engine. It demonstrates how to create a scene, add entities to it, and interact with them using VR controllers. Developers can modify the code to create their own VR experiences, such as games or simulations.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is an example of XR Picking using the PlayCanvas engine. It creates a grid of cubes and allows the user to pick and change the color of the closest cube using input source rays.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code imports the entire PlayCanvas engine using the wildcard import syntax. It also uses HTML and CSS to create a message element.

3. What is the expected output of this code?
- The expected output of this code is an interactive 3D scene displayed on an HTML canvas. The user can enter VR mode by tapping the screen and pick and change the color of the closest cube using input source rays. A message element is also displayed to provide instructions to the user.
