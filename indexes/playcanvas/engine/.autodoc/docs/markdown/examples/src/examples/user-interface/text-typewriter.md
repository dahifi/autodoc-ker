The `TextTypewriterExample` class is a code example that demonstrates how to create a typewriter effect for text in a PlayCanvas application. The example creates a 2D screen with a text element that wraps text over several lines. The text is initially empty, and the example uses a timer to render a new character every 75ms until the entire text is displayed. 

The example uses the PlayCanvas engine to create a graphics device, initialize an application, and create entities for the camera, screen, and text. The `createGraphicsDevice` method creates a graphics device for the specified canvas element and device type. The `AppBase` class initializes the application with the specified options, including the graphics device, mouse, touch, and element input. The `setCanvasFillMode` and `setCanvasResolution` methods set the canvas to fill the window and automatically change resolution to be the same as the canvas size. 

The `Asset` class is used to load the font asset, which is used by the text element. The `AssetListLoader` class is used to load the font asset and start the application when the asset is loaded. The `Entity` class is used to create entities for the camera, screen, and text. The `addComponent` method is used to add components to the entities, including the camera component, screen component, and element component. The `pc.Color` class is used to set the clear color for the camera component. 

The `TextTypewriterExample` class is exported as the default export of the module, which allows it to be imported and used in other modules. The `CATEGORY`, `NAME`, and `WEBGPU_ENABLED` static properties are used to categorize the example and indicate whether it is compatible with the WebGPU API. 

Example usage:

```javascript
import TextTypewriterExample from 'path/to/TextTypewriterExample';

const canvas = document.getElementById('application-canvas');
const deviceType = 'webgl2';

const example = new TextTypewriterExample();
example.example(canvas, deviceType);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is an example of a text typewriter feature in the PlayCanvas engine, which renders a new character of a given text every 75ms.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code imports the PlayCanvas engine module and uses HTMLCanvasElement, pc.Asset, pc.GraphicsDevice, pc.Mouse, pc.TouchDevice, pc.ElementInput, pc.AppOptions, pc.AppBase, pc.Entity, pc.Color, and pc.Vec2 classes.

3. What is the significance of the `WEBGPU_ENABLED` property?
- The `WEBGPU_ENABLED` property is a boolean flag that indicates whether the example supports the WebGPU API, which is a new graphics rendering API that provides better performance and efficiency than WebGL.
