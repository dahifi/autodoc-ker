The code above is a module that exports three classes: `GamepadExample`, `KeyboardExample`, and `MouseExample`. These classes are examples of how to use gamepad, keyboard, and mouse input in the PlayCanvas engine.

The `import` statements at the beginning of the code import the three classes from separate files located in the same directory as this module. This allows for modularization and separation of concerns in the codebase.

The `export` statement at the end of the code exports the three classes as named exports. This means that when another module imports this module, they can access these classes by their respective names.

For example, if another module wanted to use the `KeyboardExample` class, they could import it like this:

```
import { KeyboardExample } from "./inputExamples";
```

Then, they could create a new instance of the `KeyboardExample` class and use it to handle keyboard input in their PlayCanvas project.

Overall, this module serves as a helpful resource for developers using the PlayCanvas engine who want to learn how to handle gamepad, keyboard, and mouse input. By providing examples of how to use these input methods, developers can save time and effort in implementing these features in their own projects.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of this code file?**\
This code file is exporting three modules: `GamepadExample`, `KeyboardExample`, and `MouseExample`. It is likely that these modules provide examples or utilities related to gamepad, keyboard, and mouse input handling.

2. **Where are the modules `GamepadExample`, `KeyboardExample`, and `MouseExample` defined?**\
These modules are imported from three separate files located in the same directory as this code file: `gamepad.js`, `keyboard.js`, and `mouse.js`.

3. **How can a developer use these exported modules in their code?**\
A developer can import these modules into their code using the `import` statement and the appropriate file path. For example, to use the `KeyboardExample` module, a developer could write `import { KeyboardExample } from "./path/to/this/file";`.
