The code defines a class called `VrBasicExample` that provides an example of how to use the PlayCanvas engine to create a basic VR scene. The class has a single method called `example` that takes two parameters: a canvas element and a device type. The method creates a PlayCanvas application, sets up a camera and a light, and creates a grid of cubes. It also sets up event listeners for mouse, touch, and keyboard input, and handles the activation and deactivation of VR mode.

The `example` method first creates a message function that displays a message on the screen. It then creates a new PlayCanvas application using the provided canvas element and sets up input devices for mouse, touch, and keyboard. It sets the fill mode of the canvas to fill the window and the resolution to auto. It also sets the maximum pixel ratio of the graphics device to the device pixel ratio of the window.

Next, it creates a camera entity and a light entity and adds them to the root of the scene. It then defines a function called `createCube` that creates a new cube entity at the specified position and adds it to the root of the scene. It uses this function to create a grid of cubes.

If VR is supported by the browser, the method sets up event listeners for mouse and touch input to activate and deactivate VR mode. It also sets up an event listener for the keyboard to end the VR session when the ESC key is pressed. It also sets up event listeners for the `start`, `end`, and `available` events of the XR system to display messages on the screen.

If VR is not supported by the browser, the method displays a message on the screen indicating that WebXR is not supported.

Overall, this code provides a basic example of how to use the PlayCanvas engine to create a VR scene and handle input events. It can be used as a starting point for more complex VR projects.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is an example of a basic VR application using the PlayCanvas engine.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code imports the PlayCanvas engine from a relative path.

3. What is the expected input and output of the `example` function?
- The `example` function takes in an HTML canvas element and a device type as arguments, and does not have a return value. It sets up a PlayCanvas application with a camera, light, and grid of cubes, and adds event listeners for VR activation and deactivation.
