The `VrHandsExample` class is a code example that demonstrates how to use the PlayCanvas engine to create a virtual reality (VR) experience with hand tracking. The purpose of this code is to show how to use the PlayCanvas engine to create a VR application that supports hand tracking and input. 

The `example` method is the main entry point of the code. It takes two parameters: a canvas element and a device type. The method creates a new PlayCanvas application and sets up the canvas element as the rendering target. It also creates a camera and a light source, and adds them to the scene. 

The `createCube` function creates a grid of cubes in the scene. The `createController` function creates a new controller entity for each input source (e.g., hand or grip) and adds it to the scene. The function also handles the removal of the controller entity when the input source is removed. 

The code uses the `app.xr` object to check if the browser supports WebXR. If WebXR is supported, the code sets up event listeners for mouse and touch input to activate the VR experience. The code also sets up event listeners for keyboard input to end the VR session. 

The code uses the `app.xr.input` object to listen for new input sources (e.g., hand or grip) and creates a new controller entity for each input source. The code updates the position and rotation of each controller entity based on the input source data. 

The code also handles hand tracking events, such as when tracking is lost or recovered. When tracking is lost, the code changes the color of the hand joints to red. When tracking is recovered, the code changes the color of the hand joints to white. 

Overall, this code demonstrates how to use the PlayCanvas engine to create a VR experience with hand tracking and input. Developers can use this code as a starting point to create their own VR applications using the PlayCanvas engine.
