The `CustomShaderExample` class is a code example that demonstrates how to create a custom shader for a PlayCanvas engine project. The purpose of this code is to show how to create a custom shader that can be used for simple UI shaders. The code example includes a vertex shader and a fragment shader that are used to create a new material with an additive alpha blending effect. The material is then applied to a UI image element.

The `CustomShaderExample` class has a static `example` method that takes three parameters: a canvas element, a device type, and an object containing the vertex and fragment shader code. The method creates a new `pc.GraphicsDevice` object using the `pc.createGraphicsDevice` method and initializes a new `pc.AppBase` object with the graphics device. It then creates a camera and a 2D screen entity and adds them to the app's root entity. The method then creates a new shader from the vertex and fragment shader code using the `pc.createShaderFromCode` method and creates a new material with the shader and additive alpha blending. Finally, the method creates a new UI image element with the custom material and adds it to the screen entity.

The `example` method also updates the material's `amount` parameter to animate the inverse effect. It does this by adding an event listener to the app's `update` event and updating the material's `amount` parameter with a sine wave that varies from 0 to 1.

This code example can be used as a starting point for creating custom shaders for PlayCanvas engine projects. Developers can modify the vertex and fragment shader code to create custom effects and apply them to UI elements or other entities in their projects.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is an example of a custom shader for a user interface in the PlayCanvas engine.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code imports the entire PlayCanvas library and requires an HTML canvas element, a device type string, and two shader files as input.

3. What does this code do?
- This code creates a custom shader for a UI image element using a vertex and fragment shader, sets up a camera and screen, and animates the inverse effect of the image using a sine wave.
