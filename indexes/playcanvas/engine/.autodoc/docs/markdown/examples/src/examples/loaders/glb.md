The `GlbExample` class is a code example that demonstrates how to load and display a glTF Binary (GLB) file in the PlayCanvas engine. The GLB file contains meshes, lights, and cameras, and the example switches between the cameras every two seconds. 

The `example` method takes two parameters: a `canvas` element and a `deviceType` string. The `canvas` element is used to create a graphics device, and the `deviceType` string specifies the type of device to create. 

The GLB file is loaded using the `pc.Asset` class, which is passed to an `AssetListLoader` instance along with the `app.assets` object. Once the assets are loaded, the GLB file is instantiated as a render entity, and its cameras and lights are enabled. 

The example uses the `pc.CameraComponent` and `pc.LightComponent` classes to manipulate the cameras and lights in the scene. The `pc.CameraComponent` class is used to set the aspect ratio, aperture, shutter, and sensitivity of the cameras, while the `pc.LightComponent` class is used to enable the lights in the scene. 

The example also uses the `pc.AppBase` class to create an instance of the PlayCanvas application, and the `pc.createGraphicsDevice` function to create a graphics device. The `pc.AppOptions` class is used to specify the graphics device and component systems and resource handlers to use. 

Finally, the example uses the `app.on` method to listen for the `update` event, which is fired every frame. The `update` event is used to switch between the cameras every two seconds. 

Overall, the `GlbExample` class provides a simple example of how to load and display a GLB file in the PlayCanvas engine. It demonstrates how to use the `pc.Asset` class to load assets, the `pc.CameraComponent` and `pc.LightComponent` classes to manipulate cameras and lights, and the `pc.AppBase` class to create a PlayCanvas application.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is an example of loading a glb file that contains meshes, lights, and cameras, and switching between the cameras every 2 seconds.

2. What dependencies are required for this code to run?
- This code requires the PlayCanvas engine and the glslang and twgsl libraries.

3. What is the expected output of running this code?
- The expected output is a canvas displaying a 3D scene loaded from a glb file, with multiple cameras and lights, and the cameras switching every 2 seconds.
