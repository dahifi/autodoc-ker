The `MeshMorphExample` class is a code example that demonstrates how to use the PlayCanvas engine to create and manipulate 3D meshes with morph targets. The purpose of this code is to show how to create a mesh with morph targets, which can be used to animate the mesh by blending between different shapes. 

The `example` method is the main entry point of the code. It takes an HTML canvas element and a device type as input, and initializes the PlayCanvas engine with the specified graphics device. It then creates a scene with a directional light, a camera, and three morph instances. Each morph instance is a mesh with three morph targets, which are created by expanding a part of a sphere along three planes specified by their normal vectors. The morph targets are then blended together by modifying their weights along a sine curve with different frequencies. 

The `createMorphTarget` function is a helper function that takes the original positions, normals, and indices of a mesh, and creates a morph target by modifying the positions and normals based on a specified plane normal. The function first calculates the shortest distance from each vertex to the plane, and then modifies the distance to a displacement amount using a smoothstep function. The function then generates new positions by extruding each vertex along the normal by the displacement amount. The function also generates new normals based on the modified positions and indices, and calculates the delta positions and normals between the base position/normal and the modified position/normal. Finally, the function creates a morph target object with the delta positions and normals. 

The `createMorphInstance` function is another helper function that creates a mesh instance with a morph instance. The function first creates a base mesh, which is a sphere with a high amount of vertices and triangles. The function then obtains the base mesh vertex and index data, and builds three morph targets by calling the `createMorphTarget` function with different plane normals. The function then creates a morph object with the three morph targets, and sets the morph object to the mesh's `morph` property. The function then creates a mesh instance with a standard material, and adds a morph instance to the mesh instance. The function also creates an entity with a render component that uses the mesh instance, and adds the entity to the scene. Finally, the function returns the morph instance. 

The `shortestDistance` function is another helper function that calculates the shortest distance from a point to a plane defined by its normal vector. The function takes the point coordinates and the plane normal as input, and returns the shortest distance. 

The `MeshMorphExample` class also defines some static properties, such as `CATEGORY`, `NAME`, and `WEBGPU_ENABLED`, which are used to categorize and name the example, and to indicate whether it is compatible with the WebGPU API. 

Overall, this code demonstrates how to use the PlayCanvas engine to create and manipulate 3D meshes with morph targets, which can be used to create complex animations and visual effects.
