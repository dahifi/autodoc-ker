The `MeshDeformationExample` class is a part of the PlayCanvas engine project and is responsible for creating an example of mesh deformation. The purpose of this code is to demonstrate how to modify mesh positions on each frame to create a waving effect. 

The `example` method takes two parameters: `canvas` and `deviceType`. The `canvas` parameter is an HTML canvas element that will be used to create a graphics device. The `deviceType` parameter is a string that specifies the type of device to create. 

The `assets` object contains two assets: a 3D model of a statue and a cubemap texture of a helipad environment. These assets are loaded using the `pc.Asset` class. 

The `gfxOptions` object contains options for creating a graphics device. It specifies the device type, as well as the URLs for the glslang and twgsl libraries. 

The `pc.createGraphicsDevice` method is used to create a graphics device using the canvas and options specified. Once the device is created, an `AppOptions` object is created with the graphics device and component systems and resource handlers are added to it. 

An instance of the `pc.AppBase` class is created with the canvas and `AppOptions` object. The canvas is set to fill the window and automatically change resolution to be the same as the canvas size. 

The `assetListLoader` object is created with the assets and the app's assets. Once the assets are loaded, the app is started. 

The `app.scene` object is used to set up the skydome and exposure. A camera entity is created and added to the app's root entity. A hierarchy of entities with render components is created to represent the statue model. The positions from all mesh instances are collected to work on. 

On each frame, the camera is orbited around the statue model. The mesh positions are modified to create a waving effect. The `tempPositions` array is used to avoid per frame allocations. The `srcPositions` array is looped over, and the `tempPositions` array is filled up with a waved version of positions from the `srcPositions` array. The `.x` and `.z` components are modified based on a sine function, which uses the `.y` component. The new positions are set on the mesh, and the mesh is updated. 

In summary, the `MeshDeformationExample` class is an example of how to modify mesh positions on each frame to create a waving effect. It demonstrates how to create a graphics device, load assets, create entities with render components, and modify mesh positions. This code can be used as a reference for creating similar effects in other PlayCanvas projects.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is an example of mesh deformation using the PlayCanvas engine.

2. What external resources does this code depend on?
- This code depends on a 3D model file and a cubemap texture file, both of which are located in the '/static/assets' directory.

3. What is the expected output of this code?
- The expected output of this code is a 3D model of a statue with mesh deformation applied to it, which can be viewed and interacted with in a web browser.
