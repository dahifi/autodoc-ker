The code is responsible for generating HTML files for each example in the PlayCanvas engine project. It does this by reading a directory of example files, creating a list of categories and examples, and then generating HTML files for each example using a Handlebars template.

The code starts by importing the necessary modules, including the fs module for reading and writing files, Handlebars for generating HTML templates, and path and url modules for working with file paths. It then defines some constants and functions, including a function for loading the HTML template, a list of categories, and a function for reading directory names.

The loadHtmlTemplate function reads an HTML template file using the fs module, compiles it using Handlebars, and returns the compiled template. The categoriesList array is used to store the list of categories and examples, which is generated by reading the directory of example files using the readDirectoryNames function. For each category, the code creates a directory in the dist folder if it doesn't already exist, and then generates an HTML file for each example in that category using the loadHtmlTemplate function. The generated HTML file is written to a directory in the dist folder named after the category and example.

Finally, the code writes the categoriesList array to a file named examples.json in the dist folder. This file is used by the PlayCanvas engine to generate a list of examples that can be viewed in the browser.

Overall, this code is an important part of the PlayCanvas engine project, as it allows developers to easily generate HTML files for each example in the project. By automating this process, the code saves developers time and effort, and ensures that the examples are consistent and up-to-date.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `loadHtmlTemplate` function?
   - The `loadHtmlTemplate` function reads an HTML template file, compiles it using Handlebars, and returns the compiled template with the provided data.
2. What is the `categoriesList` variable used for?
   - The `categoriesList` variable is an array that stores objects representing each category of examples in the `src/examples` directory, along with the list of examples in each category.
3. What is the output of this code?
   - The output of this code is a JSON file located at `dist/examples.json` that contains an array of objects representing each category of examples in the `src/examples` directory, along with the list of examples in each category. Additionally, for each example, an HTML file is generated in the `dist` directory with the compiled template and example-specific data.
