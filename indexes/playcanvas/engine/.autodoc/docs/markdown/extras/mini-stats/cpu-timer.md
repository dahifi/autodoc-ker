The code defines a class called `CpuTimer` that is used to measure the time taken by different parts of the PlayCanvas engine. The class constructor takes an instance of the PlayCanvas application as an argument and sets up event listeners for the `frameupdate`, `framerender`, and `frameend` events. These events are fired by the PlayCanvas engine at different stages of the frame rendering process.

The `CpuTimer` class has several properties and methods that are used to measure and store timing information. The `_frameIndex` property is used to keep track of the current frame index, while the `_frameTimings`, `_timings`, and `_prevTimings` properties are arrays that store timing information for the current frame, the previous frame, and the frame before that, respectively. The `unitsName` and `decimalPlaces` properties are used to specify the units and precision of the timing information.

The `begin` method is called at the beginning of each frame and is used to reset the timing information for the current frame. It first checks if the timer is enabled and returns if it is not. It then clears any timing information that was collected for the current frame and swaps the `_timings` and `_frameTimings` arrays. Finally, it calls the `mark` method to mark the beginning of the frame.

The `mark` method is called at different stages of the frame rendering process and is used to record the time taken by each stage. It first checks if the timer is enabled and returns if it is not. It then records the current timestamp and calculates the time taken by the previous mark or the previous frame, depending on the value of `_frameIndex`. It then updates the `_frameTimings` array with the name and timestamp of the current mark and increments the `_frameIndex`.

The `timings` getter method is used to retrieve the timing information for the current frame. It first removes the last time point from the `_timings` array, which represents the time spent outside of PlayCanvas. It then maps the remaining time points to an array of time values and returns it.

Overall, the `CpuTimer` class is an important part of the PlayCanvas engine that is used to measure the performance of different parts of the engine. It can be used to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize the engine for better performance. Here is an example of how the `CpuTimer` class can be used:

```
import { CpuTimer } from 'playcanvas';

const app = new pc.Application();
const timer = new CpuTimer(app);

// enable the timer
timer.enabled = true;

// start the application
app.start();

// do some rendering
app.render();

// get the timing information for the current frame
const timings = timer.timings;

console.log(timings);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `CpuTimer` class?
- The `CpuTimer` class is used to measure the time taken by different parts of the PlayCanvas engine during a frame update.

2. What events is the `CpuTimer` class listening to?
- The `CpuTimer` class is listening to the `frameupdate`, `framerender`, and `frameend` events.

3. What is the purpose of the `timings` getter?
- The `timings` getter returns an array of timings for each frame update, excluding the time spent outside of PlayCanvas.
