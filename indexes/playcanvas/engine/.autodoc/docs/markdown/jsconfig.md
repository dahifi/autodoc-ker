[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/playcanvas/engine/jsconfig.json)

This code is a configuration file for the TypeScript compiler used in the PlayCanvas engine project. The `compilerOptions` object specifies various settings for the compiler, including the `baseUrl` which is set to the current directory, `checkJs` which enables type checking in JavaScript files, `module` which is set to ES6 module format, `target` which is set to ES6, `moduleResolution` which is set to node, and `typeRoots` which specifies the directories to search for type definitions.

The `include` array specifies the files and directories to include in the compilation process. The `src/**/*` pattern includes all files and subdirectories in the `src` directory, while `rollup.config.mjs` includes the Rollup configuration file.

This configuration file is important for ensuring that the TypeScript code in the PlayCanvas engine project is compiled correctly and with the desired settings. It allows developers to write code in TypeScript and have it transpiled to JavaScript that can run in modern browsers.

An example of how this configuration file is used in the project can be seen in the `package.json` file, where the `tsc` command is used to compile the TypeScript code using this configuration:

```
"scripts": {
  "build": "tsc"
},
```

Overall, this configuration file is a crucial part of the PlayCanvas engine project, as it ensures that the TypeScript code is compiled correctly and with the desired settings, allowing developers to write code in a modern and efficient way.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of this code?**\
This code is a configuration file for the TypeScript compiler options used in the PlayCanvas engine project.

2. **What is the significance of the "checkJs" option being set to true?**\
The "checkJs" option being set to true means that the TypeScript compiler will perform type checking on JavaScript files as well as TypeScript files.

3. **What is the role of the "typeRoots" option in this configuration file?**\
The "typeRoots" option specifies the directories where the TypeScript compiler should look for type definitions. In this case, it includes directories for WebGPU and general types.
