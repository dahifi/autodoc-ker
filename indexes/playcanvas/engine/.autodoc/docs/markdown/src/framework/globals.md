The code above defines two functions, `getApplication()` and `setApplication()`, and exports them for use in other parts of the PlayCanvas engine project. 

The `getApplication()` function simply returns the value of a variable called `currentApplication`. This variable is initially undefined, but can be set to an instance of the PlayCanvas application using the `setApplication()` function. 

The `setApplication()` function takes an argument `app`, which is expected to be an instance of the PlayCanvas application. It sets the value of `currentApplication` to this instance, and then calls a method from the `GraphicsDeviceAccess` module to set the graphics device for the application. 

Overall, these functions provide a way for other parts of the PlayCanvas engine to access the current application instance and its graphics device. For example, if another module needs to render graphics, it can call `getApplication()` to get the current application instance, and then access its graphics device through the `graphicsDevice` property. 

Here is an example of how these functions might be used in another module:

```
import { getApplication } from "./application.js";

const app = getApplication();
const graphicsDevice = app.graphicsDevice;

// Use the graphics device to render something...
```

By using the `getApplication()` function, this module can access the current application instance without needing to know how it is stored or managed internally. This helps to keep the code modular and maintainable.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `GraphicsDeviceAccess` import?**\
   The `GraphicsDeviceAccess` import is used to access the graphics device of the current application.

2. **What is the significance of the `currentApplication` variable?**\
   The `currentApplication` variable is used to store the current application instance.

3. **What does the `setApplication` function do?**\
   The `setApplication` function sets the current application instance and also sets the graphics device of the application using the `GraphicsDeviceAccess` module.
