The code defines a class called `AnimBlendTreeDirect` which extends another class called `AnimBlendTree`. The purpose of this class is to calculate normalized weight values for a blend tree. A blend tree is a data structure used in animation systems to blend multiple animations together based on certain parameters. 

The `calculateWeights()` method is the main function of this class. It first checks if the parameter values have been updated and returns if they have. It then calculates the sum of the weights of all the children nodes in the blend tree. If the `_syncAnimations` flag is set to true, it also calculates the weighted duration sum of all the child animations. 

Next, it iterates through all the children nodes and calculates the weight of each child based on its parameter value and the total weight sum. If `_syncAnimations` is true, it also calculates the weighted speed of each child based on its duration, absolute speed, and the weighted duration sum. If the total weight sum is zero, it sets the weight and weighted speed of the child to zero. 

This class is used in the larger PlayCanvas engine project to provide animation blending functionality. Developers can create instances of this class and add child nodes to create blend trees for their animations. They can then call the `calculateWeights()` method to calculate the normalized weight values for each child node based on their parameter values and the total weight sum. This allows for smooth blending between multiple animations based on certain parameters. 

Example usage:

```
import { AnimBlendTreeDirect } from 'playcanvas-engine';

// create a new blend tree
const blendTree = new AnimBlendTreeDirect();

// add child nodes to the blend tree
blendTree.addChild(node1);
blendTree.addChild(node2);
blendTree.addChild(node3);

// set parameter values for each child node
blendTree.setParameterValue(node1, 0.5);
blendTree.setParameterValue(node2, 0.2);
blendTree.setParameterValue(node3, 0.3);

// calculate the normalized weight values for each child node
blendTree.calculateWeights();

// use the normalized weight values to blend animations
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the PlayCanvas engine?
- This code defines a class called `AnimBlendTreeDirect` which extends `AnimBlendTree` and calculates normalized weight values for animations. It is part of the PlayCanvas engine's animation system.

2. What is the significance of the `_syncAnimations` property and how does it affect the calculations?
- The `_syncAnimations` property determines whether the animation durations and speeds of child nodes should be taken into account when calculating weights. If it is `true`, then `weightedDurationSum` and `child.weightedSpeed` will be calculated and used in the weight calculation.

3. What is the purpose of the `updateParameterValues()` method and when would it return `true`?
- The `updateParameterValues()` method updates the parameter values of the blend tree. It returns `true` if any of the parameter values have changed since the last update, indicating that the weights need to be recalculated.
