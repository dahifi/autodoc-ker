The `ModelComponentSystem` class is a component system that allows an entity to render a 3D model or a primitive shape like a box, capsule, sphere, cylinder, cone, etc. This class extends the `ComponentSystem` class and is used to manage `ModelComponent` instances. 

The `ModelComponentSystem` class has a constructor that initializes the `id`, `ComponentType`, `DataType`, `schema`, and `defaultMaterial` properties. The `id` property is a string that identifies the component system. The `ComponentType` property is a reference to the `ModelComponent` class. The `DataType` property is a reference to the `ModelComponentData` class. The `schema` property is an array of strings that define the properties of the component. The `defaultMaterial` property is the default material used for rendering.

The `ModelComponentSystem` class has an `initializeComponentData` method that initializes the data of a `ModelComponent` instance. This method takes a `component`, `_data`, and `properties` parameter. The `component` parameter is the `ModelComponent` instance to initialize. The `_data` parameter is the data to initialize the component with. The `properties` parameter is an array of strings that define the properties to initialize. 

The `ModelComponentSystem` class has a `cloneComponent` method that clones a `ModelComponent` instance. This method takes an `entity` and `clone` parameter. The `entity` parameter is the entity to clone the component from. The `clone` parameter is the entity to clone the component to.

The `ModelComponentSystem` class has an `onRemove` method that is called when a component is removed from an entity. This method takes an `entity` and `component` parameter. The `entity` parameter is the entity the component was removed from. The `component` parameter is the component that was removed.

Overall, the `ModelComponentSystem` class is an important part of the PlayCanvas engine project as it allows entities to render 3D models and primitive shapes. It provides methods for initializing, cloning, and removing `ModelComponent` instances.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file defines the ModelComponentSystem class, which allows an entity to render a model or a primitive shape.

2. What properties can be initialized for a ModelComponent?
- Properties that can be initialized for a ModelComponent include material, materialAsset, asset, castShadows, receiveShadows, castShadowsLightmap, lightmapped, lightmapSizeMultiplier, type, mapping, layers, isStatic, and batchGroupId.

3. What does the cloneComponent method do?
- The cloneComponent method creates a new ModelComponent instance with the same properties as the original entity's ModelComponent, and clones the original model if it is of type asset but has no specified asset. It also copies relevant mesh instance properties and custom AABB if they exist.
