This file contains a set of constants and a regular expression that are used throughout the PlayCanvas engine project to define and validate various types of assets and URLs.

The `ABSOLUTE_URL` constant is a regular expression that matches absolute URLs, including protocol-relative URLs, data URLs, and blob URLs. This regular expression is used to validate URLs throughout the PlayCanvas engine, ensuring that only valid URLs are used to load assets and resources.

The remaining constants define the various types of assets that can be loaded and used in the PlayCanvas engine. These include animations, audio files, images, JSON data, models, materials, text files, textures, texture atlases, cubemaps, shaders, CSS files, HTML files, scripts, and containers. These constants are used throughout the PlayCanvas engine to identify and load the appropriate assets for a given scene or project.

For example, to load an image asset in PlayCanvas, you would use the `ASSET_IMAGE` constant to identify the asset type, like this:

```
const asset = app.assets.find('my-image.png', ASSET_IMAGE);
```

Overall, this file provides a set of useful constants and regular expressions that are used throughout the PlayCanvas engine to ensure that assets and resources are loaded correctly and efficiently.
