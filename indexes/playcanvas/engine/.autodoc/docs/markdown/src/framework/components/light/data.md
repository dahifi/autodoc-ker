The code above defines a class called `LightComponentData` that is used to store data related to a light component in the PlayCanvas engine. The purpose of this class is to provide a default set of properties for a light component, which can be customized by the user as needed.

The `LightComponentData` class has a constructor that initializes two private variables `_props` and `_propsDefault` with values from the `component.js` file. These variables are arrays that contain the names of properties and their default values for a light component.

The constructor then loops through the `_props` array and sets the corresponding property of the `LightComponentData` instance to its default value. If the default value is an object that has a `clone` method, the method is called to create a copy of the object. This is done to ensure that each instance of `LightComponentData` has its own copy of the default values, rather than sharing a reference to the same object.

The `LightComponentData` class is exported so that it can be used by other parts of the PlayCanvas engine. For example, when a new light component is created, an instance of `LightComponentData` is created and used to initialize the component's properties.

Here is an example of how the `LightComponentData` class might be used:

```javascript
import { LightComponentData } from 'playcanvas-engine';

class LightComponent {
    constructor() {
        this.data = new LightComponentData();
    }
}

const light = new LightComponent();
console.log(light.data.color); // outputs the default color value for a light component
```

In this example, a new `LightComponent` instance is created, which initializes its `data` property with a new instance of `LightComponentData`. The default color value for a light component can then be accessed through the `data` property.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `component.js` file that is being imported?
   - The `component.js` file is being imported to access the `_lightProps` and `_lightPropsDefault` variables.

2. What is the significance of the `clone()` method being used in the `for` loop?
   - The `clone()` method is used to create a copy of the value being assigned to `this[_props[i]]` if the value has a `clone` property.

3. What is the expected output of this file?
   - This file exports a class called `LightComponentData` that initializes its properties based on the values in `_lightPropsDefault`.
