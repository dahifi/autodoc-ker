The `AnimTrack` class is a component of the PlayCanvas engine that stores the curve data required to animate a set of target nodes. It can be linked to the nodes it should animate using the `AnimComponent#assignAnimation` method. 

The class has a constructor that takes in a name, duration, inputs, outputs, curves, and animEvents. The name is a string that represents the name of the AnimTrack. The duration is a number that represents the duration of the track in seconds. The inputs and outputs are lists of curve key data and curve value data, respectively. The curves are a list of curves, and animEvents is a sequence of animation events. 

The class has several getter methods that return the name, duration, inputs, outputs, and curves of the AnimTrack. It also has a setter method that sets the animation events that will fire during the playback of this anim track. 

The `eval` method of the class evaluates all track curves at the specified time and stores the results in the provided snapshot. It takes in a time and a snapshot as parameters. The snapshot is an object that contains a cache and results. The cache is an array that stores the evaluated inputs, and the results are an array that stores the evaluated outputs. 

The `AnimTrack` class can be used to create animations for objects in a 3D scene. For example, if you have a character in a game that needs to walk, you can create an AnimTrack that stores the curve data for the character's walking animation. You can then link the AnimTrack to the character using the `AnimComponent#assignAnimation` method. When the game is played, the AnimTrack will be used to animate the character's walking motion. 

Overall, the `AnimTrack` class is an essential component of the PlayCanvas engine that enables developers to create complex animations for objects in a 3D scene.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `AnimEvents` class imported at the beginning of the file?
- The `AnimEvents` class is used to store a sequence of animation events that will fire during the playback of an animation track.

2. What is the significance of the `EMPTY` static property of the `AnimTrack` class?
- The `EMPTY` property is a pre-defined instance of the `AnimTrack` class that can be used as a placeholder track when creating a state graph before having all associated animation data available.

3. What is the purpose of the `eval` method in the `AnimTrack` class?
- The `eval` method is used to evaluate all track curves at a specified time and store the results in a provided snapshot. It updates the cache and results arrays for the inputs and outputs of the curves, respectively.
