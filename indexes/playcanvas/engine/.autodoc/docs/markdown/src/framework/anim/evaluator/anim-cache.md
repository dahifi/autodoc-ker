The code defines a class called `AnimCache` that is used to cache data for the evaluation of a single curve timeline. The purpose of this class is to optimize the performance of the animation system by pre-calculating certain values that are used repeatedly during the evaluation of an animation curve.

The `AnimCache` class has several members that are calculated per-segment, such as the time of the left and right knots, the distance between the current knots, and the index of the left and right knots. These members are recalculated whenever the time value being evaluated falls outside the current segment.

The class also has members that are calculated per-time evaluation, such as the normalized time and the hermite weights. The normalized time is calculated based on the current time value and the left and right knots of the current segment. The hermite weights are used to calculate the output anim data for cubic interpolation.

The `AnimCache` class has a method called `eval` that is used to evaluate the output anim data at the current time. The method takes three arguments: `result`, `interpolation`, and `output`. The `result` argument is an array that will contain the output anim data. The `interpolation` argument is an integer that specifies the type of interpolation to use (either cubic, linear, or step). The `output` argument is an object that contains the input and output data for the animation curve.

If the interpolation type is step, the method simply copies the data from the current segment to the `result` array. If the interpolation type is linear, the method uses the `math.lerp` function to interpolate between the data from the left and right knots of the current segment. If the interpolation type is cubic, the method uses the hermite weights to calculate the output anim data.

Overall, the `AnimCache` class is an important part of the PlayCanvas engine's animation system. It helps to optimize the performance of the system by pre-calculating certain values that are used repeatedly during the evaluation of an animation curve.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `AnimCache` class?
- The `AnimCache` class is used for internal cache data for the evaluation of a single curve timeline.

2. What are the different types of interpolation supported by this code?
- The different types of interpolation supported by this code are `INTERPOLATION_CUBIC`, `INTERPOLATION_LINEAR`, and `INTERPOLATION_STEP`.

3. What is the purpose of the `update` method in the `AnimCache` class?
- The `update` method in the `AnimCache` class is used to update the internal cache data based on the current time and input data.
