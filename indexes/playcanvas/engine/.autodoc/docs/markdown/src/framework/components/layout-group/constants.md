This code defines four constants that are used to control the fitting logic of child elements within a parent container. The purpose of this code is to provide a simple way to specify how child elements should be sized and positioned within a container.

The first constant, FITTING_NONE, disables all fitting logic. This means that child elements will not be resized or repositioned in any way.

The second constant, FITTING_STRETCH, stretches child elements to fit the parent container. This means that child elements will be resized to fill the available space within the container.

The third constant, FITTING_SHRINK, shrinks child elements to fit the parent container. This means that child elements will be resized to fit within the available space, even if this means making them smaller than their natural size.

The fourth constant, FITTING_BOTH, applies both STRETCH and SHRINK fitting logic where applicable. This means that child elements will be resized to fill the available space if they are too small, and shrunk to fit within the available space if they are too large.

These constants can be used in conjunction with other code to create flexible and responsive user interfaces. For example, a layout engine might use these constants to determine how to position and size child elements within a container based on the available space and the desired layout.

Here is an example of how these constants might be used in a layout engine:

```
import { FITTING_STRETCH, FITTING_SHRINK } from 'playcanvas-engine';

function layout(container, children) {
  // Determine the available space within the container
  const availableWidth = container.clientWidth;
  const availableHeight = container.clientHeight;

  // Determine the desired size and position of each child element
  children.forEach(child => {
    const { fitting } = child;

    if (fitting === FITTING_STRETCH) {
      // Stretch the child element to fill the available space
      child.width = availableWidth;
      child.height = availableHeight;
    } else if (fitting === FITTING_SHRINK) {
      // Shrink the child element to fit within the available space
      child.width = Math.min(child.width, availableWidth);
      child.height = Math.min(child.height, availableHeight);
    } else {
      // Apply both STRETCH and SHRINK fitting logic
      child.width = Math.min(child.width, availableWidth);
      child.height = Math.min(child.height, availableHeight);
      if (child.width < availableWidth || child.height < availableHeight) {
        child.width = availableWidth;
        child.height = availableHeight;
      }
    }

    // Position the child element within the container
    child.x = (availableWidth - child.width) / 2;
    child.y = (availableHeight - child.height) / 2;
  });
}
```

In this example, the `layout` function takes a container element and an array of child elements, and positions and sizes the child elements within the container based on their `fitting` property. The `FITTING_STRETCH`, `FITTING_SHRINK`, and `FITTING_BOTH` constants are used to determine how each child element should be sized and positioned.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines constants for fitting logic options in a PlayCanvas engine.

2. What are the possible values for the FITTING_* constants?
- The possible values are FITTING_NONE (0), FITTING_STRETCH (1), FITTING_SHRINK (2), and FITTING_BOTH (3).

3. How can these constants be used in PlayCanvas engine?
- These constants can be used to specify fitting logic for child elements in a parent container. For example, FITTING_STRETCH can be used to stretch child elements to fit the parent container.
