This code defines several constants related to scrolling behavior and scrollbar visibility. These constants are likely used throughout the PlayCanvas engine to provide a consistent way of referring to these different modes and options.

The first three constants (`SCROLL_MODE_CLAMP`, `SCROLL_MODE_BOUNCE`, and `SCROLL_MODE_INFINITE`) define different modes of scrolling behavior. `SCROLL_MODE_CLAMP` indicates that content should not scroll beyond its bounds, while `SCROLL_MODE_BOUNCE` allows content to scroll past its bounds and then gently bounce back. `SCROLL_MODE_INFINITE` indicates that content can scroll forever.

The next two constants (`SCROLLBAR_VISIBILITY_SHOW_ALWAYS` and `SCROLLBAR_VISIBILITY_SHOW_WHEN_REQUIRED`) define different options for when the scrollbar should be visible. `SCROLLBAR_VISIBILITY_SHOW_ALWAYS` indicates that the scrollbar should always be visible, while `SCROLLBAR_VISIBILITY_SHOW_WHEN_REQUIRED` indicates that the scrollbar should only be visible when the content exceeds the size of the viewport.

These constants are likely used throughout the PlayCanvas engine to provide a consistent way of referring to these different modes and options. For example, a component that allows scrolling may use these constants to allow the user to select the desired scrolling behavior and scrollbar visibility. 

Here is an example of how these constants might be used in a PlayCanvas script:

```
import { SCROLL_MODE_CLAMP, SCROLLBAR_VISIBILITY_SHOW_ALWAYS } from 'playcanvas-engine';

// Create a new scrolling component with clamped scrolling and always-visible scrollbar
const scrollingComponent = new ScrollingComponent({
  scrollMode: SCROLL_MODE_CLAMP,
  scrollbarVisibility: SCROLLBAR_VISIBILITY_SHOW_ALWAYS
});
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines constants for different scroll modes and scrollbar visibility options.

2. How can these constants be used in the PlayCanvas engine?
- These constants can be used as parameters for functions or properties in the PlayCanvas engine that involve scrolling or scrollbar visibility.

3. Are there any other scroll modes or scrollbar visibility options available in the PlayCanvas engine?
- It is unclear from this code whether there are additional scroll modes or scrollbar visibility options available in the PlayCanvas engine.
