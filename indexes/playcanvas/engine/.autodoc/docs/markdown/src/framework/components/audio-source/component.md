The `AudioSourceComponent` class is a component that controls the playback of an audio sample. It is a part of the PlayCanvas engine project. This class will be deprecated in favor of the `SoundComponent`. 

The `AudioSourceComponent` class has several properties that can be set to control the audio playback. These properties include:

- `assets`: The list of audio assets - can also be an array of asset ids.
- `activate`: If true the audio will begin playing as soon as the scene is loaded.
- `volume`: The volume modifier to play the audio with. In range 0-1.
- `pitch`: The pitch modifier to play the audio with. Must be larger than 0.01.
- `loop`: If true the audio will restart when it finishes playing.
- `3d`: If true the audio will play back at the location of the entity in space, so the audio will be affected by the position of the `AudioListenerComponent`.
- `distanceModel`: Determines which algorithm to use to reduce the volume of the audio as it moves away from the listener. Can be:
  - "linear"
  - "inverse"
  - "exponential"
  Default is "inverse".
- `minDistance`: The minimum distance from the listener at which audio falloff begins.
- `maxDistance`: The maximum distance from the listener at which audio falloff stops. Note the volume of the audio is not 0 after this distance, but just doesn't fall off anymore.
- `rollOffFactor`: The factor used in the falloff equation.

The `AudioSourceComponent` class has several methods that can be used to control the audio playback. These methods include:

- `play(name)`: Begin playback of an audio asset in the component attached to an entity.
- `pause()`: Pause playback of the audio that is playing on the Entity. Playback can be resumed by calling `unpause()`.
- `unpause()`: Resume playback of the audio if paused. Playback is resumed at the time it was paused.
- `stop()`: Stop playback on an Entity. Playback can not be resumed after being stopped.

The `AudioSourceComponent` class also has several event handlers that are called when the properties of the component are changed. These event handlers include:

- `onSetAssets(name, oldValue, newValue)`: Called when the `assets` property is changed.
- `onSetLoop(name, oldValue, newValue)`: Called when the `loop` property is changed.
- `onSetVolume(name, oldValue, newValue)`: Called when the `volume` property is changed.
- `onSetPitch(name, oldValue, newValue)`: Called when the `pitch` property is changed.
- `onSetMinDistance(name, oldValue, newValue)`: Called when the `minDistance` property is changed.
- `onSetMaxDistance(name, oldValue, newValue)`: Called when the `maxDistance` property is changed.
- `onSetRollOffFactor(name, oldValue, newValue)`: Called when the `rollOffFactor` property is changed.
- `onSetDistanceModel(name, oldValue, newValue)`: Called when the `distanceModel` property is changed.
- `onSet3d(name, oldValue, newValue)`: Called when the `3d` property is changed.

The `AudioSourceComponent` class also has several methods that are called when the component is enabled or disabled. These methods include:

- `onEnable()`: Called when the component is enabled.
- `onDisable()`: Called when the component is disabled.

Overall, the `AudioSourceComponent` class is a useful component for controlling the playback of audio samples in a PlayCanvas project. It provides a variety of properties and methods that can be used to customize the audio playback experience.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `AudioSourceComponent` class?
- The `AudioSourceComponent` class controls the playback of an audio sample and is attached to an entity in the PlayCanvas engine.
2. What is the difference between the `play()` and `pause()` methods?
- The `play()` method begins playback of an audio asset, while the `pause()` method pauses playback of the audio that is currently playing on the entity.
3. What is the significance of the `3d` property?
- If the `3d` property is set to true, the audio will play back at the location of the entity in space and will be affected by the position of the `AudioListenerComponent`.
