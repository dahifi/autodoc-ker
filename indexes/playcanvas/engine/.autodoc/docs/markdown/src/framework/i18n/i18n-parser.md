The `I18nParser` class is responsible for parsing internationalization (i18n) data and validating its structure. The `parse` method takes in a `data` object and returns an array of `messages`. The `data` object is expected to have a `header` field with a `version` number and a `data` field that is an array of objects containing `info` and `messages` fields. The `info` field is an object that contains a `locale` string, which specifies the language of the messages. The `messages` field is an object that contains key-value pairs of message IDs and their translations.

Before parsing the data, the `_validate` method is called to ensure that the data has the correct structure. If any of the required fields are missing or have an invalid type, an error is thrown. This method is only called if the `_DEBUG` flag is set, which suggests that it is intended for development purposes only.

The `I18nParser` class is likely used in the larger PlayCanvas engine project to support internationalization of game content. Game developers can use this class to parse i18n data files and retrieve translated messages for different languages. The `parse` method could be called by other parts of the engine to retrieve the parsed messages and use them to display text in the game. For example:

```
const i18nData = {
  header: {
    version: 1
  },
  data: [
    {
      info: {
        locale: 'en-US'
      },
      messages: {
        greeting: 'Hello, world!',
        farewell: 'Goodbye, world!'
      }
    },
    {
      info: {
        locale: 'fr-FR'
      },
      messages: {
        greeting: 'Bonjour le monde!',
        farewell: 'Au revoir le monde!'
      }
    }
  ]
};

const parser = new I18nParser();
const messages = parser.parse(i18nData);

console.log(messages[0].greeting); // 'Hello, world!'
console.log(messages[1].greeting); // 'Bonjour le monde!'
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    - This code defines a class called `I18nParser` which has a method called `parse` that takes in data and returns a specific property of that data.

2. What is the expected format of the data that is passed into the `parse` method?
    - The data passed into the `parse` method should have a `header` field with a `version` property that is a number 1, a `data` field that is an array, and each element of the `data` array should have an `info` field with a `locale` property that is a string and a `messages` field.

3. What happens if the data passed into the `parse` method does not meet the expected format?
    - If the data passed into the `parse` method does not meet the expected format, the `_validate` method is called and it throws various errors depending on which fields are missing or have incorrect types.
