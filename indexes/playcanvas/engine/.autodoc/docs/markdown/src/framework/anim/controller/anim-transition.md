The code defines a class called `AnimTransition` which represents connections between `AnimStates` in a state graph. The purpose of this class is to allow for the creation of transitions between different states in an animation controller. During each frame, the controller checks if any of the `AnimTransitions` have the current `AnimState` as their source state. If so, and the conditions for the transition are met, the controller will transition to the destination state.

The `AnimTransition` class has several properties that can be set when creating a new instance of the class. These properties include the source state (`from`), the destination state (`to`), the duration of the transition (`time`), the priority of the transition (`priority`), a list of conditions that must be met for the transition to occur (`conditions`), the time at which the transition should be exited (`exitTime`), the time at which the destination state should begin playing its animation (`transitionOffset`), and the type of interruption source (`interruptionSource`).

The `from`, `to`, `time`, and `priority` properties are straightforward and define the basic parameters of the transition. The `conditions` property is an array of conditions that must be met for the transition to occur. These conditions are defined elsewhere in the code and can be used to check things like the value of a parameter or the state of a trigger.

The `exitTime` property is used to specify the exact frame during which the source state's progress passes the time specified. This is given as a normalized value of the source state's duration. If the value is less than 1, it will be checked every animation loop. The `transitionOffset` property is used to specify the time at which the destination state should begin playing its animation. This is given in normalized time, based on the state's duration and must be between 0 and 1.

The `interruptionSource` property is used to define whether another transition can interrupt this one and which of the current or previous states transitions can do so. This is one of `pc.ANIM_INTERRUPTION_*` and defaults to `pc.ANIM_INTERRUPTION_NONE`.

Overall, the `AnimTransition` class is an important part of the animation controller in the PlayCanvas engine. It allows for the creation of transitions between different states in an animation, which is essential for creating complex animations with multiple states. Here is an example of how the `AnimTransition` class might be used:

```javascript
import { AnimTransition } from 'playcanvas-engine';

const transition = new AnimTransition({
  from: 'idle',
  to: 'walk',
  time: 0.5,
  priority: 1,
  conditions: [
    { parameter: 'speed', operator: '>', value: 0 }
  ],
  exitTime: 0.9,
  transitionOffset: 0.2,
  interruptionSource: pc.ANIM_INTERRUPTION_PREVIOUS
});
```

In this example, a new `AnimTransition` instance is created with the source state set to `'idle'` and the destination state set to `'walk'`. The transition has a duration of `0.5` seconds and a priority of `1`. The transition will only occur if the value of the `'speed'` parameter is greater than `0`. The transition will be exited at `0.9` normalized time and the destination state will begin playing its animation at `0.2` normalized time. Finally, the transition can be interrupted by transitions from the previous state.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `AnimTransition` class?
    
    The `AnimTransition` class represents connections in the controller's state graph between `AnimStates`, and is used to transition between states based on parameter-based conditions.

2. What options can be passed to the `AnimTransition` constructor?
    
    The `AnimTransition` constructor can be passed options such as the source and destination states, the duration of the transition, a priority value, a list of conditions that must be met for the transition to be used, and more.

3. What is the purpose of the `interruptionSource` option in the `AnimTransition` constructor?
    
    The `interruptionSource` option defines whether another transition can interrupt this one and which of the current or previous states transitions can do so, and defaults to `pc.ANIM_INTERRUPTION_NONE`.
