The code defines a class called `XrLightEstimation` that provides illumination data from the real world, which is estimated by the underlying AR system. It provides a reflection Cube Map, that represents the reflection estimation from the viewer position. A more simplified approximation of light is provided by L2 Spherical Harmonics data. And the most simple level of light estimation is the most prominent directional light, its rotation, intensity, and color.

The class extends the `EventHandler` class and has several private and public properties. The private properties include `_manager`, `_supported`, `_available`, `_lightProbeRequested`, `_lightProbe`, `_intensity`, `_rotation`, `_color`, and `_sphericalHarmonics`. The public properties include `supported`, `available`, `intensity`, `color`, `rotation`, and `sphericalHarmonics`.

The class has several methods including `_onSessionStart`, `_onSessionEnd`, `start`, `end`, and `update`. The `_onSessionStart` method is called when the XR session starts and checks if light estimation is supported. The `_onSessionEnd` method is called when the XR session ends and resets the `_supported`, `_available`, `_lightProbeRequested`, and `_lightProbe` properties.

The `start` method starts the estimation of illumination data. If it fails to start estimation, an `error` event is fired. The `end` method ends the estimation of illumination data. The `update` method updates the `_intensity`, `_color`, `_rotation`, and `_sphericalHarmonics` properties based on the light estimate from the AR system.

The `supported` property returns true if Light Estimation is supported. The `available` property returns true if estimated light information is available. The `intensity` property returns the intensity of what is estimated to be the most prominent directional light. The `color` property returns the color of what is estimated to be the most prominent directional light. The `rotation` property returns the rotation of what is estimated to be the most prominent directional light. The `sphericalHarmonics` property returns the spherical harmonics coefficients of what is estimated to be the most prominent directional light.

This class is used in the PlayCanvas engine to provide illumination data from the real world in AR applications. It can be used to adjust the lighting in the scene to match the real-world lighting conditions.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `XrLightEstimation` class?
- The `XrLightEstimation` class provides illumination data from the real world, which is estimated by the underlying AR system. It provides a reflection Cube Map, that represents the reflection estimation from the viewer position. A more simplified approximation of light is provided by L2 Spherical Harmonics data. And the most simple level of light estimation is the most prominent directional light, its rotation, intensity and color.

2. What events can be fired by the `XrLightEstimation` class?
- The `XrLightEstimation` class can fire two events: `available` when light estimation data becomes available, and `error` when light estimation has failed to start.

3. What are the properties that can be accessed from the `XrLightEstimation` class?
- The `XrLightEstimation` class has several properties that can be accessed, including `supported` which is true if Light Estimation is supported, `available` which is true if estimated light information is available, `intensity` which is the intensity of what is estimated to be the most prominent directional light, `color` which is the color of what is estimated to be the most prominent directional light, and `rotation` which is the rotation of what is estimated to be the most prominent directional light.
