The code defines the Untar and UntarWorker classes, which are used to extract files from a tar archive. The Untar class is used to extract files from a tar archive in the form of an ArrayBuffer. The UntarWorker class is a wrapper around the Untar class that uses a Web Worker to extract files from a tar archive. 

The Untar class has a private constructor that takes an ArrayBuffer as a parameter. The constructor creates a DataView object from the ArrayBuffer and initializes some private variables. The untar() method is used to extract the files from the tar archive. It returns an array of file descriptors in the format {name, start, size, url}. The name property is the name of the file, the start property is the offset of the file data in the ArrayBuffer, the size property is the size of the file data in bytes, and the url property is a URL that can be used to access the file data. 

The UntarWorker class has a constructor that takes an optional filenamePrefix parameter. The constructor creates an instance of the Untar class and a Web Worker. The untar() method is used to extract the files from the tar archive using the Web Worker. It takes an ArrayBuffer as a parameter and a callback function that is called when the extraction is complete. The callback function has two parameters: an error message (if any) and an array of file descriptors. The hasPendingRequests() method is used to check if there are any pending requests to extract files from tar archives. The destroy() method is used to terminate the Web Worker and free up any resources used by the UntarWorker instance. 

The code also defines the PaxHeader class, which is used to parse PAX headers in the tar archive. The PaxHeader class has a constructor that takes an array of fields as a parameter. The applyHeader() method is used to apply the PAX header to a file descriptor. 

The code uses the TextDecoder interface to decode the data in the tar archive. If the TextDecoder interface is not available, the code logs a warning message and returns an empty array. 

The code also defines the UntarScope function, which is used as the code that ends up in a Web Worker. The function initializes some private variables and defines some private methods. The function also defines the onmessage handler for the Web Worker. 

The code uses a Blob URL to create a Web Worker. The URL is created by converting the UntarScope function to a string and adding the onmessage handler for the Web Worker. The URL is used to create a new instance of the Web Worker in the UntarWorker constructor. 

Overall, the code provides a way to extract files from a tar archive using a Web Worker. The Untar class can be used to extract files from a tar archive in the main thread, while the UntarWorker class can be used to extract files from a tar archive in a separate thread using a Web Worker.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Untar` variable and why is it declared outside the `UntarScope` function?
- The `Untar` variable is used to store the `UntarInternal` constructor function. It is declared outside the `UntarScope` function so that a `return` statement does not need to be added to the function. This is necessary because the `UntarScope` function is used as the code that ends up in a Web Worker.
2. What is the purpose of the `PaxHeader` function and how is it used?
- The `PaxHeader` function is used to parse PAX headers in a tar archive. It takes a buffer, start index, and length as arguments and returns a `PaxHeader` object. The `applyHeader` method of the `PaxHeader` object is used to apply the header fields to a file descriptor object.
3. What is the purpose of the `UntarWorker` class and how is it used?
- The `UntarWorker` class is used to untar a tar archive using a Web Worker. It takes an array buffer and a callback function as arguments and returns an array of file descriptors. The `hasPendingRequests` method is used to check if there are any pending requests to untar array buffers, and the `destroy` method is used to terminate the internal Web Worker.
