The code above is a module called `WebgpuUtils` that is used to convert a combination of shader stages into GPU shader stages. It imports three constants from a file called `constants.js`: `SHADERSTAGE_VERTEX`, `SHADERSTAGE_FRAGMENT`, and `SHADERSTAGE_COMPUTE`. These constants are used to represent the different stages of a shader program.

The `shaderStage` method is a static method of the `WebgpuUtils` class. It takes a parameter called `stage`, which is a combination of the three shader stages. The method then uses bitwise operators to check which stages are included in the combination and sets the corresponding bits in the `ret` variable. Finally, the method returns the `ret` variable, which is a combination of the GPU shader stages.

This module is likely used in the larger PlayCanvas engine project to facilitate the creation and management of shader programs. By converting a combination of shader stages into GPU shader stages, this module can simplify the process of creating and managing shader programs. For example, if a developer wants to create a shader program that only uses the vertex and fragment stages, they can pass `SHADERSTAGE_VERTEX | SHADERSTAGE_FRAGMENT` to the `shaderStage` method and receive the corresponding GPU shader stages. This can then be used to create a shader program that only includes those stages.

Overall, this module provides a useful utility for managing shader programs in the PlayCanvas engine project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `WebgpuUtils` class?
    - The `WebgpuUtils` class provides a static method `shaderStage` that converts a combination of `SHADER_STAGE_*` constants into `GPUShaderStage.*` constants.

2. What are the `SHADERSTAGE_VERTEX`, `SHADERSTAGE_FRAGMENT`, and `SHADERSTAGE_COMPUTE` constants?
    - These constants are likely defined in the `../constants.js` file and are used to represent different shader stages (vertex, fragment, and compute) in the PlayCanvas engine.

3. What is the output of the `shaderStage` method?
    - The `shaderStage` method returns a number that represents a combination of `GPUShaderStage.*` constants based on the input `stage` parameter, which is a combination of `SHADER_STAGE_*` constants.
