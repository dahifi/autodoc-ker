The code defines a `Mouse` class that represents a mouse device bound to a DOM element. The class extends the `EventHandler` class and provides methods to attach and detach mouse events to/from an element, enable/disable the context menu, and request/release the mouse pointer lock. The class also provides methods to check if the mouse pointer is locked, update the mouse state, and check if a mouse button is pressed, was pressed, or was released.

The `Mouse` class constructor takes an optional `element` parameter that specifies the element to attach the mouse events to. The constructor initializes the mouse state by setting the last mouse position and button states to zero. It also sets up event handlers for mouse up, down, move, and wheel events, and a context menu handler that prevents the default context menu from appearing. The `attach` method attaches the mouse events to the specified element, and the `detach` method removes the mouse events from the attached element. The `disableContextMenu` and `enableContextMenu` methods respectively disable and enable the context menu for the attached element. The `enablePointerLock` and `disablePointerLock` methods respectively request and release the mouse pointer lock, and take optional success and error callbacks. The `isPointerLocked` method checks if the mouse pointer is locked. The `update` method updates the mouse state by copying the current button state to the last button state. The `isPressed`, `wasPressed`, and `wasReleased` methods respectively check if a mouse button is currently pressed, was pressed since the last update, or was released since the last update. The `_handleUp`, `_handleDown`, `_handleMove`, and `_handleWheel` methods respectively handle mouse up, down, move, and wheel events by updating the mouse state and firing corresponding mouse events.

The `Mouse` class can be used in the larger project to handle mouse input for interactive applications and games. For example, it can be used to move a player character in response to mouse movement, or to fire a weapon in response to mouse clicks. The `Mouse` class can also be used to implement custom mouse cursors, or to enable/disable the context menu for specific elements. The `Mouse` class can be instantiated with an element parameter to attach the mouse events to a specific element, or without an element parameter to attach the mouse events to the window. The `Mouse` class can be extended or modified to add custom mouse event handlers or to support additional mouse input features.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Mouse` class?
- The `Mouse` class is a device that is bound to a DOM element and handles mouse events such as mouse movement, button presses, and wheel movement.

2. What is the difference between `isPressed`, `wasPressed`, and `wasReleased` methods?
- The `isPressed` method returns true if the specified mouse button is currently pressed. The `wasPressed` method returns true if the specified mouse button was pressed since the last call to `update`. The `wasReleased` method returns true if the specified mouse button was released since the last call to `update`.

3. What is the purpose of the `enablePointerLock` method?
- The `enablePointerLock` method requests that the browser hides the mouse cursor and locks the mouse to the element, allowing raw access to mouse movement input without risking the mouse exiting the element.
