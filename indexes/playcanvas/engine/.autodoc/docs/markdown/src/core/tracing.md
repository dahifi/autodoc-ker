# PlayCanvas Engine - Tracing

The `Tracing` class is responsible for providing log tracing functionality to the PlayCanvas engine. It allows for tracing of the internal functionality of the engine. Note that the trace logging only takes place in the debug build of the engine and is stripped out in other builds.

The class has a static `_traceChannels` set that stores the names of enabled trace channels. It also has a static `stack` property that enables call stack logging for trace calls. By default, it is set to `false`.

The `set` method is used to enable or disable a trace channel. It takes two parameters - `channel` and `enabled`. `channel` is the name of the trace channel and can be one of the following:

- `TRACEID_RENDER_FRAME`
- `TRACEID_RENDER_FRAME_TIME`
- `TRACEID_RENDER_PASS`
- `TRACEID_RENDER_PASS_DETAIL`
- `TRACEID_RENDER_ACTION`
- `TRACEID_RENDER_TARGET_ALLOC`
- `TRACEID_TEXTURE_ALLOC`
- `TRACEID_SHADER_ALLOC`
- `TRACEID_SHADER_COMPILE`
- `TRACEID_VRAM_TEXTURE`
- `TRACEID_VRAM_VB`
- `TRACEID_VRAM_IB`
- `TRACEID_RENDERPIPELINE_ALLOC`
- `TRACEID_PIPELINELAYOUT_ALLOC`

`enabled` is the new enabled state for the channel. If `enabled` is `true`, the channel is added to the `_traceChannels` set. If `enabled` is `false`, the channel is removed from the set.

The `get` method is used to test if the trace channel is enabled. It takes one parameter - `channel`, which is the name of the trace channel. It returns `true` if the trace channel is enabled, otherwise `false`.

This class can be used to enable or disable trace channels for debugging purposes. For example, if a developer wants to trace the rendering pipeline, they can enable the `TRACEID_RENDER_PASS` channel using the `set` method. They can then use the `get` method to check if the channel is enabled before logging any trace messages.

Example usage:

```javascript
import { Tracing } from 'playcanvas';

// enable the TRACEID_RENDER_PASS channel
Tracing.set(Tracing.TRACEID_RENDER_PASS, true);

// check if the TRACEID_RENDER_PASS channel is enabled
if (Tracing.get(Tracing.TRACEID_RENDER_PASS)) {
    console.log('TRACEID_RENDER_PASS is enabled');
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the Tracing class?
    
    The Tracing class provides log tracing functionality to trace the internal functionality of the engine, and it only takes place in the debug build of the engine.

2. What is the significance of the `_DEBUG` flag in the `set` method?
    
    The `_DEBUG` flag is used to ensure that trace logging only takes place in the debug build of the engine and is stripped out in other builds.

3. What are some examples of trace channels that can be enabled or disabled using the `set` method?
    
    Some examples of trace channels that can be enabled or disabled using the `set` method include `TRACEID_RENDER_FRAME`, `TRACEID_RENDER_PASS`, `TRACEID_SHADER_COMPILE`, etc.
