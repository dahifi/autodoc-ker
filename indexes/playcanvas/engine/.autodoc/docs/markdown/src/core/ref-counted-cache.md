The `RefCountedCache` class is a utility class that implements a reference counting cache for objects. The purpose of this class is to keep track of the number of references to an object and to destroy the object when the reference count reaches zero. This is useful in situations where objects are shared between different parts of the code and need to be cleaned up when they are no longer needed.

The `cache` property is a `Map` that stores the objects and their reference counts. When an object is added to the cache using the `incRef` method, its reference count is incremented. When an object is removed from the cache using the `decRef` method, its reference count is decremented. If the reference count reaches zero, the object is destroyed and removed from the cache.

The `destroy` method is used to destroy all the objects in the cache. It iterates over the `cache` map and calls the `destroy` method on each object. After all the objects have been destroyed, the `cache` map is cleared.

This class is used internally by the PlayCanvas engine to manage the lifecycle of objects. For example, when a scene is loaded, the engine creates a number of objects such as entities, lights, and cameras. These objects are added to the `RefCountedCache` so that they can be cleaned up when the scene is unloaded. Here is an example of how this class might be used:

```javascript
import { RefCountedCache } from 'playcanvas-engine';

// create a new cache
const cache = new RefCountedCache();

// create a new object and add it to the cache
const obj = { name: 'my object' };
cache.incRef(obj);

// remove the object from the cache
cache.decRef(obj);

// destroy all the objects in the cache
cache.destroy();
```

In this example, a new `RefCountedCache` is created and an object is added to the cache using the `incRef` method. The object is then removed from the cache using the `decRef` method. Finally, all the objects in the cache are destroyed using the `destroy` method.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this class and how is it used in the PlayCanvas engine?
- This class is a reference counting cache for objects, used to keep track of the number of references to an object and destroy it when the reference count reaches zero. It is likely used in the PlayCanvas engine to manage memory and prevent memory leaks.

2. What is the data structure used to implement the cache and why was it chosen?
- The cache is implemented using a Map object, where the key is the object being stored and the value is the reference count. This was likely chosen because Maps provide efficient lookup and insertion of key-value pairs.

3. What happens when an object is removed from the cache?
- When an object is removed from the cache, its destroy function is called and it is deleted from the cache. This ensures that the object is properly cleaned up and any resources it was using are released.
