The `ReadStream` class is a helper class that provides methods for reading data from an ArrayBuffer in an organized way. It is designed to be used internally within the PlayCanvas engine and is not intended for external use.

The `ReadStream` constructor takes an ArrayBuffer as its only argument and initializes the class with a DataView object that is used to read data from the ArrayBuffer. The `offset` property is set to 0, which represents the current position in the buffer that is being read. The `stack` property is an array that is used to keep track of the current state of the read stream.

The `remainingBytes` method returns the number of bytes that are left to be read in the buffer.

The `reset` method can be used to reset the current position in the buffer to a specified offset.

The `skip` method can be used to skip a specified number of bytes in the buffer.

The `align` method can be used to align the current position in the buffer to a specified number of bytes. This is useful when reading data that is aligned to a specific byte boundary.

The `readChar` method reads a single character from the buffer and returns it as a string.

The `readChars` method reads a specified number of characters from the buffer and returns them as a string.

The `readU8`, `readU16`, `readU32`, and `readU64` methods read unsigned integers of the specified size from the buffer and return them as numbers. The `readU64` method reads two 32-bit unsigned integers and combines them into a single 64-bit unsigned integer.

The `readU32be` method reads a 32-bit unsigned integer from the buffer in big-endian byte order.

The `readArray` method reads a specified number of bytes from the buffer into an existing array.

The `readLine` method reads a line of text from the buffer and returns it as a string. A line is terminated by a newline character (`\n`).

Overall, the `ReadStream` class provides a convenient and organized way to read data from an ArrayBuffer in the PlayCanvas engine. It is used extensively throughout the engine to read data from various file formats and network protocols.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ReadStream` class?
    
    The `ReadStream` class is a helper class for organized reading of memory.

2. What methods are available in the `ReadStream` class for reading data?
    
    The `ReadStream` class has methods for reading different types of data, including characters, unsigned 8-bit integers, unsigned 16-bit integers, unsigned 32-bit integers, unsigned 64-bit integers, arrays, and lines.

3. What is the purpose of the `align` method in the `ReadStream` class?
    
    The `align` method is used to align the offset of the `ReadStream` instance to a multiple of a specified number of bytes.
