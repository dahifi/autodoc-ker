# Mat3.js

The `Mat3.js` file contains the implementation of a 3x3 matrix class called `Mat3`. This class is used to represent 3x3 matrices and provides various methods to manipulate and transform them. 

## Class Definition

The `Mat3` class is defined using the `class` keyword in JavaScript. It has the following properties and methods:

### Properties

- `data`: A `Float32Array` that stores the matrix elements in the form of a flat array.

### Methods

- `constructor()`: A constructor method that creates a new `Mat3` instance and initializes it to the identity matrix.
- `clone()`: A method that creates a duplicate of the specified matrix.
- `copy(rhs)`: A method that copies the contents of a source 3x3 matrix to a destination 3x3 matrix.
- `set(src)`: A method that copies the contents of a source array[9] to a destination 3x3 matrix.
- `equals(rhs)`: A method that reports whether two matrices are equal.
- `isIdentity()`: A method that reports whether the specified matrix is the identity matrix.
- `setIdentity()`: A method that sets the matrix to the identity matrix.
- `toString()`: A method that converts the matrix to string form.
- `transpose()`: A method that generates the transpose of the specified 3x3 matrix.
- `setFromMat4(m)`: A method that converts the specified 4x4 matrix to a Mat3.
- `transformVector(vec, res)`: A method that transforms a 3-dimensional vector by a 3x3 matrix.

## Usage

The `Mat3` class can be used to represent 3x3 matrices and perform various operations on them. Here are some examples of how to use this class:

### Creating a new Mat3 instance

```javascript
const mat = new Mat3();
```

This creates a new `Mat3` instance and initializes it to the identity matrix.

### Cloning a matrix

```javascript
const mat1 = new Mat3();
const mat2 = mat1.clone();
```

This creates a new `Mat3` instance `mat1` and clones it to create another instance `mat2`.

### Copying a matrix

```javascript
const mat1 = new Mat3();
const mat2 = new Mat3();
mat2.copy(mat1);
```

This creates two new `Mat3` instances `mat1` and `mat2`, and copies the contents of `mat1` to `mat2`.

### Setting a matrix from an array

```javascript
const mat = new Mat3();
mat.set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]);
```

This creates a new `Mat3` instance `mat` and sets its elements to the values in the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`.

### Checking if two matrices are equal

```javascript
const mat1 = new Mat3();
const mat2 = new Mat3();
const isEqual = mat1.equals(mat2);
```

This creates two new `Mat3` instances `mat1` and `mat2`, and checks if they are equal.

### Checking if a matrix is the identity matrix

```javascript
const mat = new Mat3();
const isIdentity = mat.isIdentity();
```

This creates a new `Mat3` instance `mat` and checks if it is the identity matrix.

### Setting a matrix to the identity matrix

```javascript
const mat = new Mat3();
mat.setIdentity();
```

This creates a new `Mat3` instance `mat` and sets it to the identity matrix.

### Converting a matrix to string form

```javascript
const mat = new Mat3();
const str = mat.toString();
```

This creates a new `Mat3` instance `mat` and converts it to string form.

### Generating the transpose of a matrix

```javascript
const mat = new Mat3();
mat.transpose();
```

This creates a new `Mat3` instance `mat` and generates its transpose.

### Converting a 4x4 matrix to a Mat3

```javascript
const mat4 = new Mat4();
const mat3 = new Mat3();
mat3.setFromMat4(mat4);
```

This creates a new `Mat4` instance `mat4` and a new `Mat3` instance `mat3`, and converts `mat4` to `mat3`.

### Transforming a vector by a matrix

```javascript
const mat = new Mat3();
const vec = new Vec3(1, 2, 3);
const res = new Vec3();
mat.transformVector(vec, res);
```

This creates a new `Mat3` instance `mat`, a new `Vec3` instance `vec`, and a new `Vec3` instance `res`, and transforms `vec` by `mat`. The result is stored in `res`.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Vec3` import statement at the beginning of the code?
- The `Vec3` import statement is used to import the `Vec3` class from the `vec3.js` file.

2. What is the purpose of the `Mat3` class?
- The `Mat3` class represents a 3x3 matrix and provides methods for matrix operations such as cloning, copying, setting, transforming vectors, and more.

3. What are the `IDENTITY` and `ZERO` properties of the `Mat3` class?
- The `IDENTITY` property is a constant matrix set to the identity, while the `ZERO` property is a constant matrix with all elements set to 0. Both properties are instances of the `Mat3` class and are frozen to prevent modification.
