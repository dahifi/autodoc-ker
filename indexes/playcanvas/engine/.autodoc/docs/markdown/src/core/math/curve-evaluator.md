The code defines a class called `CurveEvaluator` that is used to evaluate a curve at a specific time. The class takes a `Curve` object and an initial time as input and provides a method called `evaluate` that returns the value of the curve at the given time. The class also has a private method called `_reset` that is used to calculate the weights for the curve interval at the given time.

The `CurveEvaluator` class supports different types of curves, including linear, step, smoothstep, and hermite curves. The type of curve is determined by the `type` property of the `Curve` object. If the curve is a step curve, the `evaluate` method returns the value of the first key of the curve. If the curve is a linear or smoothstep curve, the `evaluate` method calculates the normalized time `t` and uses it to interpolate between the two keys of the curve. If the curve is a hermite curve, the `evaluate` method calculates the tangents for the curve and uses them to evaluate the curve at the given time.

The `CurveEvaluator` class is used in the larger PlayCanvas engine project to provide a way to evaluate curves used in animations and other parts of the engine. For example, the `Curve` object is used in the `Animation` class to define the animation curves for each property of an animated entity. The `CurveEvaluator` class is then used to evaluate these curves at each frame of the animation to determine the value of the property at that time.

Example usage:

```javascript
import { CurveEvaluator } from 'playcanvas';

// create a curve object
const curve = {
    type: 'linear',
    keys: [
        [0, 0],
        [1, 1]
    ]
};

// create a curve evaluator object
const evaluator = new CurveEvaluator(curve);

// evaluate the curve at time 0.5
const value = evaluator.evaluate(0.5);

console.log(value); // 0.5
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `CurveEvaluator` class?
- The `CurveEvaluator` class is used to evaluate a curve at a specific time.

2. What types of curves are supported by this code?
- The code supports several types of curves, including linear, smoothstep, and hermite curves (specifically, Catmull-Rom, Cardinal, and cubic splines).

3. How are tangents calculated for hermite curves?
- Tangents for hermite curves are calculated using a formula that takes into account the tension of the curve and the spacing of the knots. The specific formula used depends on the type of hermite curve being evaluated.
