The code defines a class called `Curve` which represents a collection of keys (time/value pairs) that define a curve's shape. The curve's shape is defined by its type, which specifies an interpolation scheme for the keys. The class has several methods for manipulating and evaluating the curve.

The `Curve` class has a constructor that takes an optional array of keys and initializes the `keys` property with them. The `add` method adds a new key to the curve at the specified time and value. The `get` method returns the key at the specified index. The `sort` method sorts the keys by time. The `value` method returns the interpolated value of the curve at the specified time. The `closest` method returns the key closest to the specified time. The `clone` method returns a clone of the curve object.

The `Curve` class also has two methods for quantizing the curve at regular intervals over the range [0..1]. The `quantize` method samples the curve and returns a set of quantized values. The `quantizeClamped` method samples the curve and clamps the resulting samples to a specified range.

The `Curve` class has several properties, including `type`, which specifies the interpolation scheme for the curve, and `tension`, which controls how tangents are calculated for spline curves. The class also has a private property `_eval` which is an instance of the `CurveEvaluator` class. The `CurveEvaluator` class is not defined in this file, but it is likely used to evaluate the curve at a given time using the specified interpolation scheme.

Overall, the `Curve` class provides a way to define and manipulate curves with different interpolation schemes. It can be used in the larger project to create animations, control movement, or define other types of curves.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Curve` class?
- The `Curve` class represents a collection of keys (time/value pairs) that define the shape of a curve using a specified interpolation scheme.

2. What are the different interpolation schemes that can be used with a `Curve`?
- The interpolation scheme can be one of the following: `CURVE_LINEAR`, `CURVE_SMOOTHSTEP`, `CURVE_SPLINE`, or `CURVE_STEP`. The default is `CURVE_SMOOTHSTEP`.

3. What is the purpose of the `quantize` and `quantizeClamped` methods?
- These methods sample the curve at regular intervals over the range [0..1] and return a set of quantized values. The `quantizeClamped` method additionally clamps the resulting samples to a specified range. These methods are used internally and are not intended for external use.
