The code defines a utility class called `WasmModule` that supports immediate and lazy loading of WebAssembly (wasm) modules. The class provides three static methods: `setConfig`, `getConfig`, and `getInstance`. 

The `setConfig` method sets the configuration for a wasm module. It takes two parameters: `moduleName` and `config`. The `moduleName` parameter is a string that specifies the name of the module. The `config` parameter is an object that contains the following properties: `glueUrl`, `wasmUrl`, `fallbackUrl`, `numWorkers`, and `errorHandler`. The `glueUrl` property is the URL of the glue script, the `wasmUrl` property is the URL of the wasm script, and the `fallbackUrl` property is the URL of the fallback script to use when wasm modules aren't supported. The `numWorkers` property is the number of threads to use for modules running on worker threads, and the `errorHandler` property is a function to be called if the module fails to download.

The `getConfig` method gets the configuration for a wasm module. It takes one parameter: `moduleName`, which is a string that specifies the name of the module. The method returns the previously set configuration object or `undefined` if the module has not been configured.

The `getInstance` method gets a wasm module instance. It takes two parameters: `moduleName` and `callback`. The `moduleName` parameter is a string that specifies the name of the module. The `callback` parameter is a function that is called when the instance is available. If the instance has already been created, the callback is called immediately with the instance as the parameter. If the instance has not been created, the callback is added to the list of callbacks for the module. If the module has been configured, the `initialize` method is called to create the instance.

The `Impl` class is used internally by the `WasmModule` class. It defines several static methods and properties that are used to load and initialize wasm modules. The `modules` property is an object that stores the state of each module. The `wasmSupported` method returns `true` if the running host supports wasm modules. The `loadScript` method loads a script and calls a callback when the script has loaded or failed to load. The `loadWasm` method loads a wasm module and calls a callback when the module has been instantiated or failed to load. The `getModule` method gets the state object for a module. The `initialize` method initializes a module if it has not already been initialized.

The `cachedResult` function is a wrapper function that caches the result of a function on the first invocation and subsequently returns the cached value. It takes one parameter: `func`, which is the function to be cached. The function returns a new function that checks if the result has been cached. If the result has not been cached, the function calls the original function and caches the result. If the result has been cached, the function returns the cached result.

Overall, the `WasmModule` class provides a simple interface for loading and initializing wasm modules. It allows modules to be configured with fallback scripts and error handlers, and provides a way to lazily load modules only when they are needed.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `cachedResult` function?
- The `cachedResult` function is a wrapper function that caches the result of a function on the first invocation and returns the cached value on subsequent invocations.

2. What is the purpose of the `loadWasm` function?
- The `loadWasm` function is used to load a wasm module. It checks if the running host supports wasm modules and loads the module from the appropriate URL based on the configuration provided.

3. What is the purpose of the `WasmModule` class?
- The `WasmModule` class is a static utility class that supports immediate and lazy loading of wasm modules. It provides methods to set and get a module's configuration, and to get a module instance.
