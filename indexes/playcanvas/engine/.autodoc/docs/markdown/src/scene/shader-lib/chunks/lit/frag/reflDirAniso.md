This code exports a GLSL shader function called `getReflDir` that calculates the reflection direction of a given view direction and surface normal, taking into account the material's glossiness and anisotropy. The function takes four parameters: `worldNormal`, `viewDir`, `gloss`, and `tbn`.

`worldNormal` is a 3D vector representing the surface normal in world space. `viewDir` is a 3D vector representing the direction from the camera to the surface point being shaded. `gloss` is a float value between 0 and 1 representing the glossiness of the material, where 0 is completely matte and 1 is completely reflective. `tbn` is a 3x3 matrix representing the tangent, bitangent, and normal vectors of the surface in tangent space.

The function first calculates the roughness of the material based on the glossiness value. It then calculates the anisotropy of the material by multiplying the roughness by a global `material_anisotropy` value. If `material_anisotropy` is positive, the anisotropic direction is set to the second column of the `tbn` matrix, otherwise it is set to the first column. 

The function then calculates the anisotropic tangent and normal vectors by taking the cross product of the anisotropic direction and the view direction. It then calculates a "bent normal" vector by interpolating between the surface normal and the anisotropic normal based on the anisotropy value. Finally, it calculates the reflection direction by reflecting the negative of the view direction around the bent normal.

This function is likely used in the larger PlayCanvas engine project to calculate the reflection direction of a surface for use in various shading and lighting calculations. It may be used in conjunction with other shader functions to create realistic lighting and reflections in 3D scenes. Here is an example of how this function might be used in a shader:

```
vec3 reflDir = vec3(0.0);
getReflDir(worldNormal, viewDir, gloss, tbn);
reflDir = dReflDirW;
```

In this example, `worldNormal`, `viewDir`, `gloss`, and `tbn` are all variables representing the surface normal, view direction, glossiness, and tangent space of the surface being shaded. The `getReflDir` function is called with these variables, and the resulting reflection direction is stored in the `reflDir` variable for use in other shader calculations.
## Questions: 
 1. What does this code do?
   
   This code defines a function called `getReflDir` that calculates the reflection direction of a given view direction and world normal, taking into account material gloss, anisotropy, and a TBN matrix.

2. What is the purpose of the `/* glsl */` comment at the beginning of the code?

   This comment indicates that the code is written in GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) syntax, which is a C-like language used for programming shaders in graphics applications.

3. What is the `dReflDirW` variable used for?

   It is unclear from this code snippet what the `dReflDirW` variable is used for, as it is not defined or used anywhere else in the code. It is possible that it is a typo or a variable that is used in another part of the code.
