The code provided is a set of GLSL shader functions that perform texture sampling and color space conversion. These functions are designed to be used in conjunction with the PlayCanvas engine, which is a WebGL-based game engine that provides a high-level API for building 3D games and applications.

The first two functions, `texture2DSRGB`, perform texture sampling and gamma correction for sRGB textures. The `sampler2D` parameter specifies the texture to sample, and the `vec2` parameter `uv` specifies the texture coordinates to sample at. The first function returns a `vec4` color value, while the second function takes an additional `float` parameter `bias` that can be used to adjust the texture sampling level. Both functions use the `gammaCorrectInput` function to perform gamma correction on the sampled color value.

The next two functions, `texture2DRGBM`, perform texture sampling and decoding for RGBM textures. The `sampler2D` and `vec2` parameters are the same as before, and the functions return a `vec3` color value. The second function takes an additional `float` parameter `bias` that can be used to adjust the texture sampling level. These functions use the `decodeRGBM` function to decode the sampled color value from the RGBM format.

The final two functions, `texture2DRGBE`, perform texture sampling and decoding for RGBE textures. The `sampler2D` and `vec2` parameters are the same as before, and the functions return a `vec3` color value. The second function takes an additional `float` parameter `bias` that can be used to adjust the texture sampling level. These functions also use the `decodeRGBM` function to decode the sampled color value from the RGBE format.

Overall, these functions provide a set of utility functions for working with different types of textures in the PlayCanvas engine. They allow developers to easily sample and convert textures between different color spaces, which is an important part of rendering high-quality 3D graphics.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code provides functions for sampling textures in different color spaces and applying gamma correction and bias.

2. What is the difference between the `texture2DSRGB` and `texture2DRGBM` functions?
    
    The `texture2DSRGB` functions apply gamma correction to the texture samples, while the `texture2DRGBM` functions decode the RGBM format used for compressed textures.

3. What is the `texture2DRGBE` function and how does it differ from the other functions?
    
    The `texture2DRGBE` function decodes the RGBE format used for high dynamic range textures, and it is similar to the `texture2DRGBM` function but with a different decoding algorithm.
