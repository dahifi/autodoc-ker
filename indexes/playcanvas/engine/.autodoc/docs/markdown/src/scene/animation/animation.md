The code defines three classes: `Key`, `Node`, and `Animation`. These classes are used to create and manage animations in the PlayCanvas engine.

The `Key` class represents a single keyframe in an animation. It has four properties: `time`, `position`, `rotation`, and `scale`. `time` is a number representing the time in seconds at which the keyframe occurs. `position`, `rotation`, and `scale` are vectors representing the position, rotation, and scale of the animated object at the given time.

The `Node` class represents a single node in an animation hierarchy. It has two properties: `_name` and `_keys`. `_name` is a string representing the name of the node. `_keys` is an array of `Key` objects representing the keyframes for the node.

The `Animation` class represents an animation sequence. It has four properties: `name`, `duration`, `_nodes`, and `_nodeDict`. `name` is a string representing the name of the animation. `duration` is a number representing the duration of the animation in seconds. `_nodes` is an array of `Node` objects representing the nodes in the animation hierarchy. `_nodeDict` is an object that maps node names to `Node` objects.

The `Animation` class also has three methods: `getNode`, `addNode`, and `get nodes`. `getNode` takes a node name as an argument and returns the `Node` object with that name. `addNode` takes a `Node` object as an argument and adds it to the `_nodes` array and `_nodeDict` object. `get nodes` is a getter method that returns the `_nodes` array.

Overall, these classes provide a way to create and manage animations in the PlayCanvas engine. For example, a developer could create an `Animation` object, add `Node` objects to it, and then use the `Key` class to define the keyframes for each node. The `Animation` object could then be used to animate objects in a scene. Here is an example of how these classes might be used:

```
// Create a new animation
const animation = new Animation();
animation.name = 'MyAnimation';
animation.duration = 5;

// Create a new node
const node = new Node();
node._name = 'MyNode';

// Add keyframes to the node
node._keys.push(new Key(0, new pc.Vec3(0, 0, 0), new pc.Quat(), new pc.Vec3(1, 1, 1)));
node._keys.push(new Key(5, new pc.Vec3(0, 0, 10), new pc.Quat(), new pc.Vec3(1, 1, 1)));

// Add the node to the animation
animation.addNode(node);

// Use the animation to animate an object
const entity = new pc.Entity();
entity.addComponent('model', { type: 'box' });
entity.addComponent('animation', { assets: [], speed: 1 });
entity.animation.play('MyAnimation');
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Key` class?
    
    The `Key` class represents a keyframe in an animation and stores information about its time, position, rotation, and scale.

2. What is the relationship between the `Node` and `Animation` classes?
    
    The `Node` class represents a node in a skeletal hierarchy and contains an array of keyframes. The `Animation` class is a sequence of keyframe arrays which map to the nodes of a skeletal hierarchy and controls how the nodes of the hierarchy are transformed over time.

3. What is the purpose of the `_nodeDict` property in the `Animation` class?
    
    The `_nodeDict` property is a dictionary that maps node names to their corresponding `Node` instances. It is used by the `getNode` method to retrieve a `Node` instance by name.
