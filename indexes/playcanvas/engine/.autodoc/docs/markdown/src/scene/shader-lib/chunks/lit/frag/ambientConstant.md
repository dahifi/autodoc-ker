The code above is a GLSL shader function that adds ambient lighting to a 3D scene. The function takes in a world normal vector as a parameter and updates the diffuse light value by adding the global ambient light value. 

In a 3D scene, ambient lighting is the light that is present in the environment and is not coming from any specific light source. This function allows for the addition of ambient lighting to a scene by updating the diffuse light value. 

This code can be used in the larger PlayCanvas engine project to create more realistic and dynamic lighting in 3D scenes. For example, if a scene is set in a dark room, the ambient lighting can be set to a low value to create a more realistic and moody atmosphere. On the other hand, if a scene is set in a bright outdoor environment, the ambient lighting can be set to a higher value to simulate the natural light present in the environment. 

Here is an example of how this function can be used in a shader:

```
uniform vec3 worldNormal;
uniform vec3 light_globalAmbient;

void main() {
    vec3 dDiffuseLight = vec3(0.0);
    addAmbient(worldNormal);
    // other lighting calculations
    // ...
    gl_FragColor = vec4(dDiffuseLight, 1.0);
}
```

In this example, the `addAmbient` function is called with the `worldNormal` vector and the `light_globalAmbient` value is added to the `dDiffuseLight` value. This updated `dDiffuseLight` value is then used in other lighting calculations to determine the final color of the fragment. 

Overall, this GLSL shader function is a useful tool for adding ambient lighting to 3D scenes in the PlayCanvas engine project.
## Questions: 
 1. What does the `/* glsl */` comment indicate in the code?
   - The `/* glsl */` comment indicates that the code is written in GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) syntax.

2. What is the purpose of the `addAmbient` function?
   - The `addAmbient` function adds the global ambient light to the diffuse light value.

3. What is the data type of the `worldNormal` parameter in the `addAmbient` function?
   - The `worldNormal` parameter is of type `vec3`, which represents a 3-component vector in GLSL.
