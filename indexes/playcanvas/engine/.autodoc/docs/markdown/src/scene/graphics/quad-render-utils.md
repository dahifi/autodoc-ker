The code defines two functions, `drawQuadWithShader` and `drawTexture`, that are used to draw screen-space quads and textures, respectively. These functions are part of the PlayCanvas engine project and are located in a file that imports various modules from the engine.

The `drawQuadWithShader` function takes in a graphics device, a render target, a shader, a viewport rectangle, and a scissor rectangle. It sets the cull mode to none and the depth state to no depth, prepares a quad for rendering with the given shader, and renders the quad to the render target using a render pass. If no viewport or scissor rectangle is provided, it defaults to the full size of the render target or the device. This function is useful for drawing post-processing effects or other screen-space effects.

The `drawTexture` function takes in a graphics device, a texture, a render target, a shader, a viewport rectangle, and a scissor rectangle. It sets the texture as a constant texture source, and then calls `drawQuadWithShader` to render the texture to the render target. If no shader is provided, it defaults to the copy shader of the graphics device. This function is useful for drawing textures to the screen or to a render target.

Both functions have an optional `useBlend` parameter that is no longer used and will log a warning if provided.

Overall, these functions provide a convenient way to draw screen-space quads and textures with a given shader and are likely used extensively throughout the PlayCanvas engine project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `drawQuadWithShader` function?
- The `drawQuadWithShader` function is used to draw a screen-space quad using a specific shader, with options to specify the render target, viewport and scissor rectangle.

2. What is the purpose of the `drawTexture` function?
- The `drawTexture` function is used to draw a texture in screen-space, with options to specify the render target, viewport and scissor rectangle.

3. What is the purpose of the `Debug` and `DebugHelper` imports?
- The `Debug` and `DebugHelper` imports are used for debugging purposes, such as logging warnings and pushing/popping GPU markers.
