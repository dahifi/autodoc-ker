[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/playcanvas/engine/src/scene/shader-lib/chunks/lit/frag/outputAlphaOpaque.js)

This code exports a default GLSL fragment shader that sets the alpha value of the output color to 1.0, making it fully opaque. 

In the context of the PlayCanvas engine, this shader could be used to render objects with solid colors or textures without any transparency. It may be applied to materials used in 3D models or UI elements. 

Here is an example of how this shader could be used in a PlayCanvas project:

```javascript
// create a new material with the opaque shader
var material = new pc.StandardMaterial();
material.chunks.diffusePS = /* glsl */`
    gl_FragColor.rgb = texture2D(uDiffuseMap, vUv0).rgb;
    gl_FragColor.a = 1.0;
`;

// assign the material to a mesh instance
var meshInstance = new pc.MeshInstance(node, mesh, material);
```

In this example, a new `StandardMaterial` is created and its `diffusePS` property is set to the opaque shader code. This material is then assigned to a `MeshInstance` which is attached to a node in the scene. When the scene is rendered, the mesh will be drawn with fully opaque colors. 

Overall, this code provides a simple and reusable shader for rendering opaque objects in PlayCanvas projects.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   
   This code sets the alpha value of the output color to 1.0 in a GLSL fragment shader.

2. What is the expected input to this code?
   
   This code is a standalone GLSL fragment shader and does not have any input dependencies. 

3. Can this code be used in other rendering engines or is it specific to PlayCanvas?
   
   This code is not specific to PlayCanvas and can be used in any rendering engine that supports GLSL fragment shaders.
