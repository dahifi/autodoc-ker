The code above is a GLSL shader code that defines three functions used for mapping textures in the PlayCanvas engine. The purpose of these functions is to map a normalized equirectangular UV to a given rectangle, taking into account a 1-pixel seam. 

The first function, `mapUv`, takes a normalized equirectangular UV and a rectangle as input and returns a mapped UV. The rectangle is defined by a vec4 that contains the x and y coordinates of the top-left corner of the rectangle, as well as its width and height. The function uses the `mix` function to interpolate between the x and y coordinates of the rectangle and the corresponding coordinates of the UV, taking into account the 1-pixel seam.

The second function, `mapRoughnessUv`, takes a normalized equirectangular UV and a roughness level as input and returns a mapped UV. The roughness level is a float value that determines the level of roughness of the material. The function uses the `exp2` function to calculate the size of the atlas rectangle based on the roughness level, and then calls the `mapUv` function to map the UV to the correct atlas rectangle.

The third function, `mapShinyUv`, takes a normalized equirectangular UV and a shiny level as input and returns a mapped UV. The shiny level is a float value that determines the level of shininess of the material. The function uses the `exp2` function to calculate the size of the atlas rectangle based on the shiny level, and then calls the `mapUv` function to map the UV to the correct atlas rectangle.

These functions are used in the PlayCanvas engine to map textures to the correct atlas rectangle based on their roughness and shininess levels. This is important for creating realistic materials in 3D scenes. For example, a rough surface will have a different texture than a smooth surface, and the PlayCanvas engine uses these functions to ensure that the correct texture is applied to each surface. 

Here is an example of how these functions might be used in a PlayCanvas project:

```
// create a material with a roughness level of 0.5 and a shiny level of 0.8
var material = new pc.StandardMaterial();
material.roughness = 0.5;
material.shininess = 0.8;

// map the texture to the correct atlas rectangle based on the roughness and shininess levels
var uv = new pc.Vec2(0.5, 0.5);
var roughnessUv = mapRoughnessUv(uv, material.roughness);
var shinyUv = mapShinyUv(roughnessUv, material.shininess);

// set the texture coordinates of the material to the mapped UV
material.diffuseMapUv = shinyUv;
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code defines functions to map normalized equirect UV coordinates to the correct atlas rectangle based on roughness and shiny levels.

2. What is the significance of the `atlasSize` and `seamSize` constants?
    
    `atlasSize` is fixed at 512 pixels and represents the size of the atlas. `seamSize` is calculated as 1 pixel divided by `atlasSize` and represents the size of the seam between atlas rectangles.

3. What is the expected input and output of the `mapUv`, `mapRoughnessUv`, and `mapShinyUv` functions?
    
    The `mapUv` function takes a normalized equirect UV coordinate and a rectangle and returns a mapped UV coordinate. The `mapRoughnessUv` and `mapShinyUv` functions take a normalized equirect UV coordinate and a roughness or shiny level and return a mapped UV coordinate.
