The code above defines a set of functions that perform gamma correction on input and output colors. Gamma correction is a technique used in computer graphics to adjust the brightness and contrast of images to match the way they are perceived by the human eye. 

The `gammaCorrectInput` function takes a single float, vec3, or vec4 color value as input and returns the same value without any modification. This function is used to indicate that the input color has already been gamma-corrected and does not need to be adjusted further.

The `gammaCorrectOutput` function takes a vec3 color value as input and returns the same value without any modification. This function is used to indicate that the output color should not be gamma-corrected before being displayed.

The code is written in GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language), which is a high-level language used to write shaders for graphics processing units (GPUs). Shaders are programs that run on the GPU and are used to perform various tasks such as rendering 3D graphics, applying post-processing effects, and performing image processing operations.

In the context of the PlayCanvas engine, this code may be used in shaders that are used to render 3D scenes. The gamma correction functions can be used to ensure that colors are displayed accurately on different types of displays, such as monitors and televisions. 

For example, the following code snippet shows how the `gammaCorrectInput` function can be used in a shader to adjust the brightness and contrast of a texture:

```
uniform sampler2D texture;
varying vec2 uv;

void main() {
    vec4 color = texture2D(texture, uv);
    color.rgb = gammaCorrectInput(color.rgb);
    gl_FragColor = color;
}
```

In this example, the `texture` uniform represents a 2D texture that is being sampled at the current UV coordinate (`uv`). The `color` variable is set to the color value of the texture at the current UV coordinate, and the `gammaCorrectInput` function is used to adjust the brightness and contrast of the color value. The resulting color is then assigned to the `gl_FragColor` output variable, which is used to set the color of the current pixel being rendered.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of this code?** 
This code defines functions for gamma correction of input and output colors.

2. **What is the expected input and output format for these functions?** 
The functions accept either a single float or a vector of 3 or 4 floats as input, and return a vector of 3 or 4 floats as output.

3. **Are there any limitations or assumptions made by these functions?** 
The code does not specify any limitations or assumptions, but it is possible that the functions are designed for a specific color space or display technology.
