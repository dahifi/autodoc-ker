This code defines a GLSL shader function that adds fog to a given color. The function is exported as the default export of the module. 

The `addFog` function takes a `vec3` color as input and returns a modified `vec3` color with fog added. However, the function currently does not actually add any fog and simply returns the original color. 

The `dBlendModeFogFactor` variable is also defined, but it is not used in this function. It is likely used in other parts of the PlayCanvas engine to control the amount of fog applied to a scene. 

This code is likely used in the larger PlayCanvas engine project to add fog effects to 3D scenes. Developers can import this module and use the `addFog` function in their own shaders to add fog to their scenes. For example, a developer could use this function in a fragment shader to add fog to a skybox:

```
uniform samplerCube skybox;
varying vec3 vWorldPosition;

void main() {
  vec4 color = textureCube(skybox, vWorldPosition);
  vec3 foggedColor = addFog(color.rgb);
  gl_FragColor = vec4(foggedColor, color.a);
}
```

In this example, the `addFog` function is used to modify the color of the skybox based on the amount of fog in the scene. The resulting color is then output as the fragment color.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `dBlendModeFogFactor` variable?
   - It is unclear from the provided code what the `dBlendModeFogFactor` variable is used for or how it affects the code.
2. How is the `addFog` function intended to be used?
   - The `addFog` function is defined but does not currently modify the input `color` parameter. It is unclear how it is intended to be used or what its purpose is.
3. What is the significance of the `/* glsl */` comment at the beginning of the code?
   - The `/* glsl */` comment indicates that the code is written in GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) syntax, which is used for writing shaders in graphics programming.
