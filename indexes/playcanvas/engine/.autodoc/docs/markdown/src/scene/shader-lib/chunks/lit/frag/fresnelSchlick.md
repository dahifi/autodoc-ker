The code provided is a glsl shader function that calculates the Fresnel effect for a given surface. The Fresnel effect is the phenomenon where the reflectivity of a surface changes based on the angle of incidence of the incoming light. This effect is commonly seen in materials such as glass, water, and metal.

The function takes in several parameters, including the cosine of the angle between the surface normal and the incoming light, the glossiness of the surface, and the specularity of the surface. If the `LIT_IRIDESCENCE` flag is defined, the function also takes in additional parameters related to iridescence.

The function first calculates the Fresnel term using Schlick's approximation, which is a simplified model for calculating the Fresnel effect. The Fresnel term is then used to interpolate between the surface's specularity and a blurred version of the surface based on the glossiness. This creates the illusion of a smooth, reflective surface.

If the `LIT_IRIDESCENCE` flag is defined, the function also applies an iridescence effect to the surface. Iridescence is the phenomenon where the color of a surface changes based on the viewing angle. The function uses the `mix` function to blend the surface's Fresnel term with an iridescence Fresnel term based on the intensity of the iridescence effect.

The function `getFresnelCC` is a simplified version of the main `getFresnel` function that only calculates the Fresnel term and returns a constant value for the ambient reflectivity of the surface.

This code is likely used in the PlayCanvas engine to create realistic lighting and shading effects for 3D models. It can be used in conjunction with other shaders and materials to create a wide variety of surface appearances. Here is an example of how this function could be used in a shader:

```
uniform float glossiness;
uniform vec3 specularity;
varying vec3 surfaceNormal;
varying vec3 surfaceToCamera;

void main() {
    float cosTheta = dot(surfaceNormal, surfaceToCamera);
    vec3 fresnel = getFresnel(cosTheta, glossiness, specularity);
    // use fresnel to calculate final color of the surface
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines two functions for calculating the Fresnel effect in computer graphics, one with additional parameters for iridescence.

2. What is the input and output of the `getFresnel` function?
- The `getFresnel` function takes in a cosine theta value, a gloss value, and a specularity vector, and optionally an iridescenceFresnel vector and an IridescenceArgs object. It returns a vector representing the Fresnel effect with the given parameters.

3. What is the purpose of the `getFresnelCC` function?
- The `getFresnelCC` function calculates a simplified version of the Fresnel effect with a fixed constant value of 0.04 added to the result.
