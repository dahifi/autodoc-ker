The code provided is a GLSL shader function called `addLightMap`. This function takes in several parameters, including `lightmap`, `dir`, `worldNormal`, `viewDir`, `reflectionDir`, `gloss`, `specularity`, `vertexNormal`, and `tbn`. These parameters are used to calculate the diffuse lighting of a 3D object in a scene.

The `lightmap` parameter is a texture that contains precomputed lighting information for the object. The `dir` parameter is the direction of the light source, while `worldNormal` is the normal vector of the object's surface in world space. `viewDir` is the direction from the camera to the object, while `reflectionDir` is the direction of the reflected light. `gloss` is the glossiness of the object's surface, while `specularity` is the color of the specular highlights on the surface. `vertexNormal` is the normal vector of the object's surface at the current vertex, while `tbn` is the tangent, bitangent, and normal matrix that transforms the surface normal from object space to world space.

The function then adds the `lightmap` value to the `dDiffuseLight` variable, which is used to accumulate the diffuse lighting for the object.

Optionally, if the `LIT_IRIDESCENCE` flag is defined, the function also takes in `iridescenceFresnel` and `iridescence` parameters. These are used to calculate the iridescence effect on the object's surface.

Overall, this function is an important part of the PlayCanvas engine's rendering pipeline, as it calculates the diffuse lighting for 3D objects in a scene. It can be used in conjunction with other shader functions to create realistic lighting effects for games and other interactive applications. Here is an example of how this function might be used in a shader:

```
#pragma glslify: addLightMap = require('path/to/addLightMap.glsl')

void main() {
  vec3 lightmap = texture2D(uLightMap, vTexCoord).rgb;
  vec3 dir = normalize(uLightDir);
  vec3 worldNormal = normalize(vWorldNormal);
  vec3 viewDir = normalize(vViewDir);
  vec3 reflectionDir = reflect(-dir, worldNormal);
  float gloss = uGloss;
  vec3 specularity = uSpecularity;
  vec3 vertexNormal = normalize(vNormal);
  mat3 tbn = mat3(vTangent, vBitangent, vNormal);

  addLightMap(lightmap, dir, worldNormal, viewDir, reflectionDir, gloss, specularity, vertexNormal, tbn);
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What does this code do?
   This code defines a function called `addLightMap` that takes in various parameters related to lighting and adds the `lightmap` value to `dDiffuseLight`.

2. What is the purpose of the `#if defined(LIT_IRIDESCENCE)` section?
   This section is a preprocessor directive that checks if the `LIT_IRIDESCENCE` macro is defined. If it is defined, then the code within the `#if` block will be included in the final code. Otherwise, it will be excluded.

3. What is the data type of the `tbn` parameter?
   The `tbn` parameter is of type `mat3`, which is a 3x3 matrix of floating point values. It is used to transform vectors from tangent space to world space.
