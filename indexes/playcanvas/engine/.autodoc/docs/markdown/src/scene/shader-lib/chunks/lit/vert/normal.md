The code provided is a GLSL shader code that is used in the PlayCanvas engine project. The purpose of this code is to calculate the normal vector of a vertex in a 3D model. The normal vector is a vector that is perpendicular to the surface of the model at a given point. It is used to calculate the lighting and shading of the model.

The code starts by defining a uniform variable called `morphNormalTex`. This variable is used to store a texture that contains morph offsets for the normal vector. If the `MORPHING_TEXTURE_BASED_NORMAL` flag is defined, the code will apply the morph offset from the texture to the normal vector.

The `getNormal()` function is then defined. This function calculates the normal vector of a vertex based on the current state of the model. The function first checks if the `SKIN` or `INSTANCING` flags are defined. If either of these flags is defined, the function calculates the normal matrix based on the current state of the model. If neither of these flags is defined, the function uses the `matrix_normal` variable to calculate the normal matrix.

The function then calculates the temporary normal vector based on the `vertex_normal` variable. If the `MORPHING` flag is defined, the function adds the morph offsets to the temporary normal vector. The morph offsets are calculated based on the `morph_weights_a` and `morph_weights_b` variables and the `morph_nrm0` to `morph_nrm7` variables.

Finally, if the `MORPHING_TEXTURE_BASED_NORMAL` flag is defined, the function calculates the morph offset from the texture and adds it to the temporary normal vector. The function then returns the normalized normal vector by multiplying the temporary normal vector by the normal matrix.

This code is used in the PlayCanvas engine project to calculate the normal vectors of vertices in 3D models. The normal vectors are used to calculate the lighting and shading of the models. The code is flexible and can handle different types of models, including models with morph offsets for the normal vector.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `getNormal()` function?
- The `getNormal()` function returns the normal vector of a vertex, taking into account various factors such as skinning, instancing, and morphing.

2. What is the `MORPHING_TEXTURE_BASED_NORMAL` preprocessor directive used for?
- The `MORPHING_TEXTURE_BASED_NORMAL` preprocessor directive is used to indicate that the normal vector of a vertex should be adjusted based on a morph offset from a texture.

3. What are the `morph_weights_a` and `morph_weights_b` variables used for?
- The `morph_weights_a` and `morph_weights_b` variables are used to weight the contribution of each morph target to the final normal vector of a vertex, depending on which set of morph targets is being used.
