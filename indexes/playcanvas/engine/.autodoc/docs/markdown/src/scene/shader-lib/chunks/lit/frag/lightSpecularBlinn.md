The code provided is a GLSL shader function that calculates the specular lighting contribution for a given surface point. The function is called `getLightSpecular` and takes in several parameters, including the half-vector `h`, the reflection direction `reflDir`, the surface normal `worldNormal`, the view direction `viewDir`, the normalized light direction `lightDirNorm`, and the glossiness value `gloss`. The function returns a float value that represents the specular lighting contribution for the given surface point.

The `calcLightSpecular` function is called within `getLightSpecular` and is responsible for calculating the specular power value based on the glossiness input. The specular power is then used to calculate the specular lighting contribution using the Blinn-Phong lighting model. The Blinn-Phong model is an energy-conserving lighting model that approximates the behavior of real-world materials by using a combination of diffuse and specular lighting components.

The `getLightSpecular` function is likely used in the larger PlayCanvas engine project to calculate the specular lighting contribution for each surface point in a scene. This function would be called for each light source in the scene and the resulting specular lighting contributions would be combined to produce the final lighting for the scene.

Here is an example of how the `getLightSpecular` function might be used in a shader program:

```glsl
uniform vec3 lightDir;
uniform vec3 viewDir;
uniform vec3 worldNormal;
uniform float gloss;

void main() {
    vec3 reflDir = reflect(-viewDir, worldNormal);
    vec3 h = normalize(lightDir + viewDir);
    mat3 tbn = mat3(worldNormal, cross(worldNormal, vec3(0.0, 0.0, 1.0)), cross(worldNormal, vec3(0.0, 1.0, 0.0)));
    float specular = getLightSpecular(h, reflDir, worldNormal, viewDir, normalize(lightDir), gloss, tbn);
    // combine specular with other lighting components to produce final color
}
```

In this example, the `getLightSpecular` function is called with the appropriate parameters to calculate the specular lighting contribution for a given surface point. The resulting specular value is then combined with other lighting components to produce the final color for the surface point.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code calculates the specular lighting for a material using the Blinn-Phong model.

2. What are the parameters required for the `getLightSpecular` function?
- The `getLightSpecular` function requires the half vector `h`, reflection direction `reflDir`, world normal `worldNormal`, view direction `viewDir`, normalized light direction `lightDirNorm`, glossiness `gloss`, and a TBN matrix `tbn`.

3. Why is there a hack for the `specPow` variable on Mac OS X?
- Calling `pow` with a zero exponent on Mac OS X generates artifacts, so the `specPow` variable is biased up slightly to avoid this issue.
