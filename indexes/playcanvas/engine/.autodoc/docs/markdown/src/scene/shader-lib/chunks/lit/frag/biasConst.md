This code is a shader code written in GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) and it defines a function called `getShadowBias`. The purpose of this function is to calculate the shadow bias value for a given resolution and maximum bias. 

In computer graphics, shadow bias is a technique used to prevent shadow acne, which is a visual artifact that occurs when the shadow map resolution is not high enough or when the shadow map is too close to the surface it is casting shadows on. Shadow bias is added to the depth value of the shadow map to offset it from the surface, thus preventing the shadow acne. 

The `getShadowBias` function takes two parameters: `resolution` and `maxBias`. The `resolution` parameter is the resolution of the shadow map, and the `maxBias` parameter is the maximum bias value that can be used. The function simply returns the `maxBias` value, which means that it does not actually calculate the shadow bias based on the resolution. This is likely a placeholder function that can be replaced with a more sophisticated implementation in the future.

This code is likely used in the PlayCanvas engine to generate shaders for rendering 3D scenes with shadows. The `getShadowBias` function can be called from other shader code to calculate the shadow bias value for a given resolution and maximum bias. For example, the following code snippet shows how the `getShadowBias` function can be used in a shader:

```
uniform float shadowMapResolution;
uniform float shadowMaxBias;

void main() {
    float shadowBias = getShadowBias(shadowMapResolution, shadowMaxBias);
    // use the shadowBias value to offset the depth value of the shadow map
    // and prevent shadow acne
}
```

Overall, this code is a small but important part of the PlayCanvas engine that helps to improve the visual quality of rendered shadows in 3D scenes.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `#define SHADOWBIAS` line?
   - This line is defining a preprocessor macro called `SHADOWBIAS`, which may be used elsewhere in the code to enable/disable certain features or behaviors related to shadow rendering.

2. What is the expected input and output of the `getShadowBias` function?
   - The `getShadowBias` function takes in two float parameters: `resolution` and `maxBias`. It then returns the value of `maxBias`, which suggests that this function is used to calculate or retrieve a maximum value for a shadow bias parameter.

3. What is the significance of the `/* glsl */` comment at the beginning of the code?
   - This comment indicates that the code is written in the GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) syntax, which is used to write shaders for graphics rendering. The comment may be used by tools or editors to provide syntax highlighting or other features specific to GLSL.
