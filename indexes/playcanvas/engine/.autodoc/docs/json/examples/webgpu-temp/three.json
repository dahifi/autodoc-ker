  "summary": "This code is an HTML file that creates a canvas element and imports various modules from the PlayCanvas engine. It then uses these modules to create a 3D scene with morphing objects that can be viewed in a web browser. \n\nThe code first imports various modules from the PlayCanvas engine, including Asset, AppBase, Shader, Texture, and RenderTarget. It also imports modules related to creating entities, materials, and meshes. \n\nThe `onLoaded` function is called when the app is loaded and creates a 3D scene with morphing objects. It first creates a directional light and a camera entity and adds them to the scene. It then defines two helper functions: `shortestDistance` and `createMorphTarget`. The `shortestDistance` function calculates the shortest distance between a point and a plane defined by a normal vector. The `createMorphTarget` function creates a morph target from a set of positions, normals, and indices, and a plane normal. \n\nThe `createMorphInstance` function creates a morph instance by creating a sphere mesh and expanding a part of it along three planes. It then creates a morph using these three targets and adds the morph instance to the mesh instance. Finally, it creates an entity, adds a render component with the mesh instance, and adds the entity to the scene. \n\nThe `onLoaded` function creates three morph instances using the `createMorphInstance` function and updates their weights every frame. It also orbits the camera around the scene. \n\nThe `main` function creates a graphics device and initializes the app with the graphics device and various component systems and resource handlers. It then sets up the scene lighting and calls the `onLoaded` function. \n\nOverall, this code creates a 3D scene with morphing objects that can be viewed in a web browser. It demonstrates the use of various modules from the PlayCanvas engine, including entities, materials, meshes, and morph targets.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code is an example of using the PlayCanvas engine to create a WebGPU test.\n\n2. What libraries or modules are being imported in this code?\n- This code imports various modules from the PlayCanvas engine, including asset, app, graphics, entity, tracing, math, scene, components, and handlers.\n\n3. What does the `createMorphTarget` function do?\n- The `createMorphTarget` function takes in positions, normals, and indices of a mesh, as well as a plane normal, and generates a morph target by modifying the vertices and normals of the mesh based on the distance to the specified plane."
