  "summary": "This code represents a JSON object that defines the properties of a shader material in the PlayCanvas engine. The shader used in this material is the Blinn shader, which is a popular shader model used in computer graphics for simulating the appearance of materials with specular highlights.\n\nThe material properties are defined using a combination of color values, texture maps, and other parameters. The ambient and diffuse properties define the base color of the material, while the specular and shininess properties control the appearance of the specular highlights. The emissive property controls the amount of light emitted by the material, and the opacity property controls the transparency of the material.\n\nTexture maps are used to add detail to the material's appearance. The diffuseMap property specifies the texture map used for the base color, while the normalMap property specifies a texture map that encodes surface normals to add the appearance of surface detail. The emissiveMap property specifies a texture map that controls the amount of light emitted by the material, and the heightMap property specifies a texture map that encodes height information to add the appearance of surface displacement.\n\nOther properties control various aspects of the material's appearance, such as the reflectivity, refraction index, and use of fog and lighting. The cubeMapProjectionBox property specifies a bounding box that is used to project a cube map onto the material, which can be used to simulate reflections or environment mapping.\n\nOverall, this code defines a material that can be used to render 3D objects in the PlayCanvas engine with a specific appearance. By defining the material properties in this way, developers can create a wide range of different materials with different appearances and behaviors, which can be used to create complex and realistic 3D scenes. For example, the following code snippet shows how this material might be applied to a 3D model in PlayCanvas:\n\n```javascript\nvar material = new pc.StandardMaterial();\nmaterial.initializeFromJSON({\n  \"shader\":\"blinn\",\n  \"ambient\":[0.588,0.588,0.588],\n  \"diffuse\":[0.588,0.588,0.588],\n  \"diffuseMap\":\"../26020279/arm_clean.png\",\n  \"diffuseMapOffset\":[0,0],\n  \"diffuseMapTiling\":[1,1],\n  \"specular\":[0.9,0.9,0.9],\n  \"shininess\":90.9091,\n  \"emissive\":[0,0,0],\n  \"emissiveMap\":\"../26020281/arm_E.png\",\n  \"emissiveMapOffset\":[0,0],\n  \"emissiveMapTiling\":[1,1],\n  \"normalMap\":\"../26020289/arm_N_clean.png\",\n  \"normalMapOffset\":[0,0],\n  \"normalMapTiling\":[1,1],\n  \"bumpMapFactor\":0.3,\n  \"opacity\":1,\n  \"sphereMap\":\"../26020278/env_01.png\",\n  \"reflectivity\":0.2,\n  \"aoMapChannel\":\"r\",\n  \"aoMapTiling\":[1,1],\n  \"aoMapOffset\":[0,0],\n  \"occludeSpecular\":1,\n  \"diffuseMapChannel\":\"rgb\",\n  \"specularMapChannel\":\"rgb\",\n  \"specularMapTiling\":[1,1],\n  \"specularMapOffset\":[0,0],\n  \"specularAntialias\":true,\n  \"metalnessMapChannel\":\"r\",\n  \"metalnessMapTiling\":[1,1],\n  \"metalnessMapOffset\":[0,0],\n  \"metalness\":1,\n  \"conserveEnergy\":true,\n  \"glossMapChannel\":\"r\",\n  \"glossMapTiling\":[1,1],\n  \"glossMapOffset\":[0,0],\n  \"emissiveMapChannel\":\"rgb\",\n  \"emissiveIntensity\":1,\n  \"heightMapChannel\":\"r\",\n  \"heightMapTiling\":[1,1],\n  \"heightMapOffset\":[0,0],\n  \"heightMapFactor\":1,\n  \"opacityMapChannel\":\"r\",\n  \"opacityMapTiling\":[1,1],\n  \"opacityMapOffset\":[0,0],\n  \"refractionIndex\":0.6666666666666666,\n  \"cubeMapProjectionBox\":{\"center\":[0,0,0],\"halfExtents\":[0.5,0.5,0.5]},\n  \"lightMapChannel\":\"rgb\",\n  \"lightMapUv\":1,\n  \"lightMapTiling\":[1,1],\n  \"lightMapOffset\":[0,0],\n  \"depthTest\":true,\n  \"depthWrite\":true,\n  \"cull\":1,\n  \"blendType\":3,\n  \"shadowSampleType\":1,\n  \"useFog\":true,\n  \"useLighting\":true,\n  \"useSkybox\":true,\n  \"useGammaTonemap\":true,\n  \"mapping_format\":\"path\"\n});\nentity.model.material = material;\n```",
