  "summary": "This code exports a set of examples for various features of the PlayCanvas engine. The purpose of this code is to provide developers with examples of how to use different features of the engine in their projects. \n\nThe code imports several example modules, each of which demonstrates a different feature of the engine. These features include basic button functionality, custom shaders, particle systems, and text manipulation. \n\nThe `export` statement at the end of the code exports all of the imported modules, making them available for use in other parts of the project. \n\nFor example, a developer working on a project that requires text manipulation could import the `TextAutoFontSizeExample`, `TextEmojisExample`, `TextLocalizationExample`, `TextTypewriterExample`, and `TextExample` modules to see how to implement these features in their own project. \n\nSimilarly, a developer working on a project that requires UI elements could import the `ButtonBasicExample`, `ButtonSpriteExample`, `LayoutGroupExample`, `ScrollViewExample`, and `WorldUiExample` modules to see how to create and manipulate UI elements in their project. \n\nOverall, this code serves as a valuable resource for developers working with the PlayCanvas engine, providing them with examples of how to use various features of the engine in their own projects.",
