  "summary": "The code above is a module that exports several examples related to augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and extended reality (XR) using the PlayCanvas engine. The purpose of this module is to provide developers with examples of how to use the PlayCanvas engine to create AR, VR, and XR experiences.\n\nThe module imports several other modules, each of which contains an example related to AR, VR, or XR. These examples include `ArBasicExample`, `ArHitTestExample`, `VrBasicExample`, `VrControllersExample`, `VrHandsExample`, `VrMovementExample`, and `XrPickingExample`. Each of these examples demonstrates a different aspect of AR, VR, or XR development using the PlayCanvas engine.\n\nFor example, `ArBasicExample` provides a basic example of how to create an AR experience using the PlayCanvas engine. `VrControllersExample` demonstrates how to use VR controllers in a PlayCanvas VR experience. `XrPickingExample` shows how to use the PlayCanvas engine to pick objects in an XR experience.\n\nDevelopers can use these examples as a starting point for their own AR, VR, or XR projects. By studying the code and understanding how it works, developers can learn how to use the PlayCanvas engine to create immersive experiences for their users.\n\nTo use one of these examples in a project, a developer would import the desired example from this module and then use it in their code. For example, to use the `ArBasicExample`, a developer would write:\n\n```\nimport { ArBasicExample } from \"playcanvas-ar-vr-examples\";\n\n// Use ArBasicExample in code\n```\n\nOverall, this module provides a valuable resource for developers looking to create AR, VR, or XR experiences using the PlayCanvas engine.",
