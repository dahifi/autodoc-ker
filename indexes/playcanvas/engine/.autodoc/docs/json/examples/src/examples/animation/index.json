  "summary": "This code exports a set of examples from various modules within the PlayCanvas engine. These examples demonstrate different features and functionalities of the engine, such as blend trees, component properties, events, layer masks, locomotion, and tweening.\n\nThe purpose of this code is to provide developers with a set of examples that showcase how to use different features of the PlayCanvas engine. By importing these examples, developers can learn how to implement these features in their own projects.\n\nFor example, if a developer wants to learn how to use blend trees in their game, they can import the `BlendTrees1DExample` or `BlendTrees2DDirectionalExample` modules and study the code to understand how to implement blend trees in their own game. Similarly, if a developer wants to learn how to use events in their game, they can import the `EventsExample` module and study the code to understand how to use events in their own game.\n\nThis code is an important part of the PlayCanvas engine project because it helps developers learn how to use the engine's features and functionalities. By providing examples, the PlayCanvas team is making it easier for developers to get started with the engine and build high-quality games and applications.",
