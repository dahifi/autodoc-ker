  "summary": "The code above is a module that exports three examples from the PlayCanvas engine project: HelloWorldExample, MiniStatsExample, and SpineboyExample. \n\nThe purpose of this module is to provide developers with examples of how to use the PlayCanvas engine in their projects. Each of the examples demonstrates a different aspect of the engine's capabilities. \n\nThe HelloWorldExample is a simple example that shows how to create a basic scene with a single entity and a camera. The MiniStatsExample demonstrates how to use the engine's built-in stats module to display performance statistics in the corner of the screen. The SpineboyExample shows how to use the engine's Spine animation system to animate a character. \n\nDevelopers can use these examples as a starting point for their own projects, or as a reference for how to use specific features of the engine. For example, if a developer wants to add Spine animations to their game, they can refer to the SpineboyExample to see how it's done. \n\nTo use these examples in their own projects, developers can import them from this module using the following syntax:\n\n```javascript\nimport { HelloWorldExample, MiniStatsExample, SpineboyExample } from \"playcanvas-engine-examples\";\n```\n\nOverall, this module serves as a valuable resource for developers who are new to the PlayCanvas engine or who want to learn more about its capabilities.",
  "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of this code file?**\\\nA smart developer might wonder what this code file is used for and how it fits into the overall PlayCanvas engine project. This code file appears to be exporting three examples: HelloWorldExample, MiniStatsExample, and SpineboyExample.\n\n2. **What are the dependencies of this code file?**\\\nA smart developer might want to know what other files or modules this code file depends on in order to function properly. From the import statements, it appears that this code file depends on three other files: \"./hello-world\", \"./mini-stats\", and \"./spineboy\".\n\n3. **How can these examples be used in a PlayCanvas project?**\\\nA smart developer might be interested in knowing how to use these examples in their own PlayCanvas project. It's not clear from this code file alone how to use these examples, but a developer could look for documentation or examples on how to import and use these modules in a PlayCanvas project."
