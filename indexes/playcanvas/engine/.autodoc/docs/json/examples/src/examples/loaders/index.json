  "summary": "The code above is a module that exports several examples related to 3D model loading and exporting in the PlayCanvas engine project. The module imports six different examples, each located in a separate file, and exports them as named exports.\n\nThe first example, `DracoGlbExample`, is related to loading 3D models in the GLB format using the Draco compression library. This example demonstrates how to use the `DracoLoader` class from the `@loaders.gl/draco` package to decode compressed GLB data.\n\nThe second example, `LoadersGlExample`, shows how to use the `GLTFLoader` class from the `@loaders.gl/gltf` package to load 3D models in the GLTF format. This example also demonstrates how to use the `GLTFEnvironment` class to create a basic environment for the loaded model.\n\nThe third example, `GlbExample`, is similar to the first example but shows how to load uncompressed GLB data using the `GLBLoader` class from the `@loaders.gl/glb` package.\n\nThe fourth example, `GltfExportExample`, demonstrates how to export a 3D model in the GLTF format using the `GLTFExporter` class from the `@loaders.gl/gltf` package.\n\nThe fifth example, `ObjExample`, shows how to load 3D models in the OBJ format using the `OBJLoader` class from the `@loaders.gl/obj` package.\n\nFinally, the sixth example, `UsdzExportExample`, demonstrates how to export a 3D model in the USDZ format using the `USDZExporter` class from the `@loaders.gl/usdz` package.\n\nBy exporting these examples, other developers can easily learn how to use the different loaders and exporters available in the PlayCanvas engine project. For example, a developer who needs to load a 3D model in the GLTF format can refer to the `LoadersGlExample` code to see how it's done. Similarly, a developer who needs to export a 3D model in the USDZ format can refer to the `UsdzExportExample` code.",
  "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of this code file?**\\\nThis code file exports several examples related to loading and exporting 3D models in different formats using the PlayCanvas engine.\n\n2. **What are the examples included in this file?**\\\nThis file includes examples for loading and exporting 3D models in Draco GLB, regular GLB, GLTF, OBJ, and USDZ formats.\n\n3. **Where are the actual implementations of these examples located?**\\\nThe actual implementations of these examples are located in separate files imported at the beginning of this code file, such as `draco-glb.js` and `gltf-export.js`."
