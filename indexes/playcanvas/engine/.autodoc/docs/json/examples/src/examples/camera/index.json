  "summary": "The code above is a module that exports three examples of camera movement for the PlayCanvas engine. The PlayCanvas engine is a WebGL-based game engine that allows developers to create 3D games and applications that run in a web browser. \n\nThe three camera movement examples that are exported from this module are FirstPersonExample, OrbitExample, and FlyExample. These examples demonstrate different ways that a camera can be controlled in a 3D environment. \n\nThe FirstPersonExample allows the user to move the camera in a first-person perspective, as if they were walking around in the game world. The OrbitExample allows the user to orbit around a target object, as if they were controlling a camera on a tripod. The FlyExample allows the user to fly around the game world, as if they were controlling a camera on a drone. \n\nThese examples are useful for developers who are building games or applications with the PlayCanvas engine, as they provide a starting point for implementing camera movement. Developers can use these examples as a reference or modify them to fit their specific needs. \n\nHere is an example of how a developer might use the FirstPersonExample in their code:\n\n```\nimport { FirstPersonExample } from \"playcanvas-engine-examples\";\n\n// Create a new instance of the FirstPersonExample\nconst firstPerson = new FirstPersonExample();\n\n// Add the camera to the scene\nthis.entity.addChild(firstPerson.camera);\n\n// Update the camera movement every frame\nthis.app.on(\"update\", function (deltaTime) {\n    firstPerson.update(deltaTime);\n});\n```\n\nIn this example, the developer imports the FirstPersonExample from the module and creates a new instance of it. They then add the camera to the scene and update its movement every frame. This allows the user to control the camera in a first-person perspective. \n\nOverall, this module provides a useful resource for developers who are building games or applications with the PlayCanvas engine. It demonstrates different ways that a camera can be controlled in a 3D environment and provides a starting point for implementing camera movement.",
  "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of this code file?**\\\nA smart developer might wonder what this code file does and what its purpose is within the PlayCanvas engine. This code file exports three examples: FirstPersonExample, OrbitExample, and FlyExample, which are likely used to demonstrate different camera movement options within the engine.\n\n2. **What are the dependencies of this code file?**\\\nA smart developer might want to know what other files or modules this code file depends on in order to function properly. From the import statements, it appears that this code file depends on three other files: \"./first-person\", \"./orbit\", and \"./fly\".\n\n3. **How can these examples be implemented in a project?**\\\nA smart developer might be interested in using these examples in their own project and would want to know how to implement them. They can import the examples from this code file and use them as needed in their own code."
