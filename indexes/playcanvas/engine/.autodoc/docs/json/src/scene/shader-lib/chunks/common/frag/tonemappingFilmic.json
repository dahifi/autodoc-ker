  "summary": "The code above is a shader code written in GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) and it defines two functions: `uncharted2Tonemap` and `toneMap`. The purpose of these functions is to apply a tone mapping algorithm to a given color value. \n\nTone mapping is a technique used in computer graphics to map the high dynamic range (HDR) values of an image to a lower dynamic range (LDR) that can be displayed on a standard monitor. The uncharted2Tonemap function is a specific tone mapping algorithm that was developed by John Hable for the game Uncharted 2. It is designed to preserve the contrast and details of the original HDR image while still making it look natural on an LDR display.\n\nThe `uncharted2Tonemap` function takes a vec3 color value as input and applies the uncharted2Tonemap algorithm to it. The algorithm uses several constants (A, B, C, D, E, F) and a formula to map the HDR value to an LDR value. The result is a vec3 color value that has been tone mapped using the uncharted2Tonemap algorithm.\n\nThe `toneMap` function takes a vec3 color value as input and applies both the uncharted2Tonemap algorithm and a white balance correction to it. The white balance correction is achieved by scaling the color value by a factor that ensures that the brightest white value in the image is mapped to a specific value (W). The result is a vec3 color value that has been tone mapped and white balanced.\n\nThis code is likely used in the PlayCanvas engine to apply tone mapping to 3D graphics rendered in real-time. The `toneMap` function could be called in the fragment shader of a material to apply tone mapping to the color of the rendered object. The `exposure` uniform could be used to adjust the overall brightness of the image. The uncharted2Tonemap algorithm is a popular choice for tone mapping in real-time graphics due to its ability to preserve contrast and detail.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   This code defines two functions for tone mapping, which is a technique used to convert high dynamic range images to low dynamic range images for display on standard monitors.\n\n2. What are the values of A, B, C, D, E, F, and W used for?\n   These are constants used in the uncharted2Tonemap function to adjust the tone mapping curve.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the \"exposure\" uniform variable?\n   The \"exposure\" variable is used to adjust the brightness of the input color before it is tone mapped."
