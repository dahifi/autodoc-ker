  "summary": "This code exports a function called `toneMap` that takes in a `vec3` color value and returns a modified version of that color based on a uniform float value called `exposure`. The purpose of this function is to apply a tone mapping effect to the input color, which adjusts the brightness and contrast of the image to make it more visually appealing.\n\nThe `toneMap` function multiplies the input color by the `exposure` value, which effectively scales the brightness of the color. This can be used to adjust the overall brightness of an image or to compensate for differences in lighting conditions between different parts of the scene.\n\nThis code is likely part of a larger rendering pipeline in the PlayCanvas engine, which is responsible for rendering 3D scenes in real-time. The `toneMap` function may be used as a post-processing effect that is applied to the final rendered image before it is displayed on the screen. This can be used to improve the visual quality of the image and make it more appealing to the viewer.\n\nHere is an example of how this code might be used in a larger project:\n\n```javascript\n// Create a new material for a 3D object\nconst material = new pc.StandardMaterial();\n\n// Set the diffuse color of the material to red\nmaterial.diffuse.set(1, 0, 0);\n\n// Set the exposure value for the tone mapping effect\nmaterial.setParameter('exposure', 2.0);\n\n// Add the material to a 3D object in the scene\nconst entity = new pc.Entity();\nentity.addComponent('model', {\n    type: 'box',\n    material: material\n});\napp.root.addChild(entity);\n```\n\nIn this example, we create a new `StandardMaterial` for a 3D object and set its diffuse color to red. We also set the `exposure` parameter of the material to 2.0, which will be used by the `toneMap` function to adjust the brightness of the final rendered image. Finally, we add the material to a new `Entity` in the scene and add that entity to the root of the scene graph. When the scene is rendered, the `toneMap` function will be applied to the final image to adjust its brightness based on the `exposure` value we set.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   This code defines a GLSL function called `toneMap` that applies an exposure value to a given color.\n\n2. What is the expected input and output of the `toneMap` function?\n   The `toneMap` function takes a vec3 color as input and returns a modified vec3 color with exposure applied.\n\n3. How is the `exposure` value determined or set?\n   The `exposure` value is a uniform float, which means it can be set externally by the application using this code."
