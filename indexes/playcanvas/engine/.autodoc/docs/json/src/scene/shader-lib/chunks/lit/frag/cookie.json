  "summary": "The code above is a set of functions that provide light cookie functionality for non-clustered lights in the PlayCanvas engine. Light cookies are textures that are used to modify the appearance of a light source. They can be used to create various lighting effects such as shadows, reflections, and color grading.\n\nThe first four functions, `getCookie2D`, `getCookie2DClip`, `getCookie2DXform`, and `getCookie2DClipXform`, are used to retrieve a 2D light cookie texture. The `sampler2D` parameter represents the texture that is used as the light cookie. The `mat4` parameter represents the transform matrix that is used to transform the position of the light source. The `float` parameter represents the intensity of the light source. The `vec4` parameter represents the cookie matrix, and the `vec2` parameter represents the cookie offset.\n\nThe `getCookie2D` function retrieves the light cookie texture without any clipping or transformation. The `getCookie2DClip` function retrieves the light cookie texture with clipping, which means that if the projected position of the light source is outside the screen, the function returns a black color. The `getCookie2DXform` function retrieves the light cookie texture with transformation, which means that the cookie texture is transformed using the cookie matrix and offset. The `getCookie2DClipXform` function retrieves the light cookie texture with both clipping and transformation.\n\nThe last function, `getCookieCube`, is used to retrieve a cube light cookie texture. The `samplerCube` parameter represents the cube texture that is used as the light cookie. The `mat4` parameter represents the transform matrix that is used to transform the position of the light source. The `float` parameter represents the intensity of the light source. This function retrieves the light cookie texture by using the `textureCube` function, which returns a color value from the cube texture based on the direction of the light source.\n\nOverall, these functions provide a way to retrieve light cookie textures for non-clustered lights in the PlayCanvas engine. They can be used to create various lighting effects and modify the appearance of a light source.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code provides light cookie functionality for non-clustered lights in the PlayCanvas engine.\n\n2. What are the input parameters for each of the functions?\n- Each function takes in a texture sampler, a transformation matrix, a float intensity value, and additional parameters for the getCookie2DXform and getCookie2DClipXform functions.\n\n3. What is the difference between the getCookie2D and getCookie2DClip functions?\n- The getCookie2DClip function includes a check to ensure that the projected position is within the bounds of the screen before returning the texture value, while the getCookie2D function does not have this check."
