  "summary": "The code above is a module that exports an object called `shaderChunksLightmapper`. This object contains four properties, each of which is a reference to a fragment shader code file. These files are used in the PlayCanvas engine's lightmapping system.\n\nThe `bakeDirLmEndPS` and `bakeLmEndPS` shaders are used to generate lightmaps for a scene. The former is used to bake directional lightmaps, while the latter is used to bake ambient lightmaps. These shaders take in various parameters such as the lightmap texture, the scene texture, and the lightmap resolution.\n\nThe `dilatePS` shader is used to dilate the lightmap generated by the `bakeLmEndPS` shader. This is done to smooth out the edges of the lightmap and prevent any artifacts from appearing.\n\nThe `bilateralDeNoisePS` shader is used to remove any noise from the lightmap. This is done by applying a bilateral filter to the lightmap texture.\n\nOverall, this module provides the necessary fragment shaders for the PlayCanvas engine's lightmapping system. These shaders can be used by developers to generate high-quality lightmaps for their scenes, which can greatly improve the visual quality of their games or applications. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```javascript\nimport { shaderChunksLightmapper } from 'playcanvas-engine';\n\n// Use the bakeDirLmEndPS shader to generate a directional lightmap\nconst directionalLightmapShader = shaderChunksLightmapper.bakeDirLmEndPS;\n// Set the necessary parameters for the shader\ndirectionalLightmapShader.setParameter('lightmapTexture', lightmapTexture);\ndirectionalLightmapShader.setParameter('sceneTexture', sceneTexture);\ndirectionalLightmapShader.setParameter('lightmapResolution', lightmapResolution);\n// Render the scene with the directional lightmap shader\n\n// Use the bilateralDeNoisePS shader to remove noise from the lightmap\nconst denoiseShader = shaderChunksLightmapper.bilateralDeNoisePS;\n// Set the necessary parameters for the shader\ndenoiseShader.setParameter('lightmapTexture', lightmapTexture);\n// Render the denoised lightmap\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code file?\n- This code file exports an object containing shader code for the PlayCanvas engine's lightmapper.\n\n2. What are the contents of the `shaderChunksLightmapper` object?\n- The `shaderChunksLightmapper` object contains four properties, each of which is a string representing shader code for a different aspect of the lightmapper: `bakeDirLmEndPS`, `bakeLmEndPS`, `dilatePS`, and `bilateralDeNoisePS`.\n\n3. Where are the shader code files being imported from?\n- The shader code files are being imported from the `./lightmapper/frag` directory within the PlayCanvas engine."
