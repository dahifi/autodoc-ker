  "summary": "The code above is a function called `unpackNormal` that takes in a `vec4` parameter called `nmap`. The purpose of this function is to unpack a normal map stored in a `vec4` format and return it as a `vec3` format. \n\nThe normal map is a texture that stores the surface normals of a 3D model. It is used to create the illusion of surface details and improve the lighting of the model. The normal map is usually stored in a `vec4` format, where the first three components represent the x, y, and z coordinates of the normal vector, and the fourth component is unused. \n\nThe `unpackNormal` function first extracts the x, y, and z components of the normal vector by accessing the `xyz` property of the `nmap` parameter. It then scales the components by 2.0 and subtracts 1.0 from each component. This is done to convert the range of the components from [0, 1] to [-1, 1]. The resulting `vec3` is then returned.\n\nThis function can be used in the larger PlayCanvas engine project to unpack normal maps for use in lighting calculations. For example, if a 3D model has a normal map stored in a `vec4` format, the `unpackNormal` function can be called to extract the normal vector and use it in lighting calculations. \n\nHere is an example usage of the `unpackNormal` function:\n\n```javascript\n// assume nmap is a vec4 normal map texture\nvar normal = unpackNormal(nmap);\n// use normal vector in lighting calculations\n```\n\nOverall, the `unpackNormal` function is a useful utility function for working with normal maps in the PlayCanvas engine project.",
  "questions": "1. What does this code do?\n   This code exports a function called `unpackNormal` that takes in a vec4 and returns a vec3.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `/* glsl */` comment?\n   This comment indicates that the code is written in GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) syntax.\n\n3. How is the `unpackNormal` function used in the PlayCanvas engine?\n   It is unclear from this code snippet alone how the `unpackNormal` function is used in the PlayCanvas engine. Further context is needed."
