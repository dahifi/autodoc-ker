  "summary": "This code defines a set of constants and functions related to shader chunks in the PlayCanvas engine. Shader chunks are small pieces of shader code that can be combined to create more complex shaders. The `chunkVersions` object defines the API version of each chunk, which is used to validate user-supplied chunks. The `removedChunks` object lists chunks that have been removed from the API and are no longer supported.\n\nThe `validateUserChunks` function takes a user-supplied chunk object as input and checks each chunk against the `shaderChunks` and `removedChunks` objects to ensure that it is supported and up-to-date. If a chunk is not found in either object, a warning is logged. If a chunk is found in `shaderChunks`, its API version is compared to the user-supplied version to check for compatibility.\n\nThis code is likely used in the larger PlayCanvas engine project to ensure that user-supplied shader chunks are valid and compatible with the engine's API. It provides a way to validate user input and prevent errors or crashes caused by incompatible or unsupported shader code. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport { validateUserChunks } from './shaderChunkValidator.js';\n\nconst myShaderChunks = {\n  APIVersion: '1.62',\n  myCustomChunk: 'void main() { ... }'\n};\n\nvalidateUserChunks(myShaderChunks);\n// logs a warning if myCustomChunk is not a supported or outdated chunk\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `chunkVersions` object?\n   - The `chunkVersions` object maps the names of shader chunks to their corresponding API versions.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `removedChunks` object?\n   - The `removedChunks` object lists shader chunks that have been removed from the API and their corresponding API versions.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `validateUserChunks` function?\n   - The `validateUserChunks` function checks if user-supplied shader chunks are supported by the engine and warns the user if they are outdated or not supported."
