  "summary": "The code defines a class called `StandardMaterialValidator` that is responsible for validating input data for a standard material. The class has a `validate` method that takes in the input data and validates it against the defined standard material properties and types. If the `removeInvalid` flag is set to true, then invalid properties are removed from the data.\n\nThe class has an `_createEnumValidator` method that creates a validator function for validating enum values. The validator function takes in a value and checks if it is one of the allowed values for the enum.\n\nThe class has an `enumValidators` object that contains validators for the different enums used in the standard material. The enums include `occludeSpecular`, `cull`, `blendType`, `depthFunc`, and `shadingModel`.\n\nThe `validate` method loops through the input data and checks the type of each property against the defined standard material types. If the type is not recognized, the property is ignored. If the type is an enum, the validator function for that enum is used to validate the value. If the value is invalid, the property is marked as invalid and removed if the `removeInvalid` flag is set to true. If the type is a number, boolean, string, vec2, rgb, texture, boundingbox, or cubemap, the value is validated accordingly.\n\nThe `setInvalid` method is called when a property is found to be invalid. It sets the `valid` flag to false, logs a warning message, and removes the property if the `removeInvalid` flag is set to true.\n\nThe purpose of this class is to ensure that input data for a standard material is valid and conforms to the defined standard material properties and types. This is important for ensuring that the standard material behaves as expected and that unexpected errors do not occur. The class can be used in the larger project to validate input data for standard materials before they are used to create materials. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nconst validator = new StandardMaterialValidator();\nconst data = {\n    diffuse: [1, 1, 1],\n    specular: [1, 1, 1],\n    occludeSpecular: 'invalid',\n    cull: 'invalid',\n    blendType: 'invalid',\n    depthFunc: 'invalid',\n    shadingModel: 'invalid'\n};\nconst isValid = validator.validate(data);\nconsole.log(isValid); // false\nconsole.log(data); // { diffuse: [1, 1, 1], specular: [1, 1, 1] }\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `StandardMaterialValidator` class?\n- The `StandardMaterialValidator` class is used to validate input data against defined standard-material properties and types, and remove invalid properties from the data if the `removeInvalid` flag is set to true.\n\n2. What are the different types of blend modes supported by this code?\n- The different types of blend modes supported by this code include `BLEND_SUBTRACTIVE`, `BLEND_ADDITIVE`, `BLEND_NORMAL`, `BLEND_NONE`, `BLEND_PREMULTIPLIED`, `BLEND_MULTIPLICATIVE`, `BLEND_ADDITIVEALPHA`, `BLEND_MULTIPLICATIVE2X`, `BLEND_SCREEN`, `BLEND_MIN`, and `BLEND_MAX`.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `_createEnumValidator` method?\n- The `_createEnumValidator` method is used to create a function that validates whether a given value is included in a specified array of values. This method is used to validate input data against enumerated types such as `occludeSpecular`, `cull`, `blendType`, `depthFunc`, and `shadingModel`."
