  "summary": "The code above is a set of GLSL functions for gamma correction. Gamma correction is a technique used to adjust the brightness and contrast of images to make them appear more natural on different display devices. \n\nThe `gammaCorrectInput` function takes a color value as input and returns the gamma-corrected version of that color. There are three versions of this function, each taking a different type of input: a single float value, a vec3 vector, or a vec4 vector. The function calls the `decodeGamma` function to perform the gamma correction. \n\nThe `gammaCorrectOutput` function takes a vec3 vector as input and returns the gamma-corrected version of that color. If the `HDR` preprocessor macro is defined, the function simply returns the input color. Otherwise, it applies a gamma correction formula to the input color using the `pow` function. \n\nThese functions are likely used in the PlayCanvas engine to ensure that graphics are displayed correctly on different devices with varying gamma settings. For example, if a user is viewing a 3D scene on a monitor with a high gamma setting, the colors may appear washed out. By applying gamma correction, the colors can be adjusted to appear more natural on that particular display. \n\nHere is an example of how the `gammaCorrectInput` function might be used in a shader:\n\n```\nuniform float u_gamma;\n\nvoid main() {\n    vec4 color = texture2D(u_texture, v_uv);\n    color.rgb = gammaCorrectInput(color.rgb * u_brightness);\n    color.rgb *= u_contrast;\n    gl_FragColor = color;\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `gammaCorrectInput` function is used to apply gamma correction to the color value retrieved from a texture. The `u_gamma` uniform variable can be used to adjust the gamma correction value dynamically.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code provides functions for gamma correction of input and output colors.\n\n2. What is the input and output format for the gamma correction functions?\n- The input format can be a float, vec3, or vec4 color, while the output format depends on the input format and may be a float, vec3, or vec4 color.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the #ifdef HDR preprocessor directive in the gammaCorrectOutput function?\n- The #ifdef HDR directive checks if the HDR (High Dynamic Range) feature is enabled. If it is enabled, the function returns the input color as is. If it is not enabled, the function applies a gamma correction formula to the input color and returns the result."
