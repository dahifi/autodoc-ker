  "summary": "This code defines three constants that represent different distance models: linear, inverse, and exponential. These distance models are used in various parts of the PlayCanvas engine to calculate the distance between two points in 3D space. \n\nThe linear distance model calculates the distance between two points as the absolute difference between their coordinates. This is the simplest distance model and assumes that the distance between two points is a straight line.\n\nThe inverse distance model calculates the distance between two points as the reciprocal of the distance between them. This means that the closer two points are, the larger the distance value will be. This model is useful when you want to give more weight to objects that are closer to the camera.\n\nThe exponential distance model calculates the distance between two points as a function of their distance raised to a power. This model is useful when you want to give more weight to objects that are very close or very far away from the camera.\n\nDevelopers can use these constants in their code to specify which distance model they want to use in a particular calculation. For example, if a developer wants to calculate the distance between two points using the linear distance model, they can use the `DISTANCE_LINEAR` constant in their code:\n\n```\nconst distance = calculateDistance(pointA, pointB, DISTANCE_LINEAR);\n```\n\nOverall, this code provides a simple and flexible way for developers to specify different distance models in their code, which can be used in various parts of the PlayCanvas engine.",
  "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of this code?**\\\nThis code defines three constants that represent different distance models: linear, inverse, and exponential.\n\n2. **How are these constants used in the PlayCanvas engine?**\\\nWithout further context, it is unclear how these constants are used in the PlayCanvas engine. It is possible that they are used as options for calculating distances between objects or entities.\n\n3. **Are there any other distance models available in the PlayCanvas engine?**\\\nBased on this code alone, it is unclear if there are any other distance models available in the PlayCanvas engine. It is possible that these three models are the only ones available, or there may be additional models defined elsewhere in the codebase."
