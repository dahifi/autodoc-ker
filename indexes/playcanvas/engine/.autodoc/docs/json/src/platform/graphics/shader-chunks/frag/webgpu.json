  "summary": "The code provided is a GLSL shader code that defines several macros for texture sampling. These macros are used to simplify the process of sampling textures in the PlayCanvas engine project. \n\nThe first line of the code exports the code as a default module. The code then defines several macros that can be used to sample textures. These macros include `texture2D`, `texture2DBias`, `texture2DLodEXT`, `textureCube`, `textureCubeLodEXT`, and `textureShadow`. \n\nThe `texture2D` macro is used to sample a 2D texture. It takes two parameters: the texture resource and the texture coordinates. The `texture2DBias` macro is similar to `texture2D`, but it also takes a bias value as a third parameter. The `texture2DLodEXT` macro is used to sample a 2D texture with a specific level of detail. It takes three parameters: the texture resource, the texture coordinates, and the level of detail. \n\nThe `textureCube` macro is used to sample a cube texture. It takes two parameters: the texture resource and the texture coordinates. The `textureCubeLodEXT` macro is similar to `textureCube`, but it also takes a level of detail as a third parameter. The `textureShadow` macro is used to sample a shadow map. It takes two parameters: the texture resource and the texture coordinates. \n\nThe code also defines several other macros that are not currently implemented, including `texture2DProj`, `texture2DProjLodEXT`, `texture2DGradEXT`, `texture2DProjGradEXT`, and `textureCubeGradEXT`. \n\nFinally, the code defines several other macros that are used to pass and accept shadow maps and textures as function parameters. These macros include `SHADOWMAP_PASS`, `SHADOWMAP_ACCEPT`, `TEXTURE_PASS`, and `TEXTURE_ACCEPT`. \n\nOverall, this code provides a set of macros that simplify the process of sampling textures in the PlayCanvas engine project. These macros can be used in shaders to sample textures with different levels of detail and to pass and accept textures and shadow maps as function parameters.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n    \n    This code defines several macros for texture sampling and shadow map handling in GLSL shaders, as well as enabling certain extensions and defining some preprocessor directives.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `GL_EXT_samplerless_texture_functions` extension?\n    \n    This extension provides support for texture sampling without the need for a separate sampler object, which can simplify shader code and reduce memory usage.\n\n3. What other texture sampling macros are planned for implementation?\n    \n    The code includes commented-out definitions for several other texture sampling macros, such as `texture2DProj` and `textureCubeGradEXT`, which may be implemented in the future."
