  "summary": "The `DebugGraphics` class is an internal graphics debug system used for GPU markers and similar debugging functionality. This class is only executed in the debug build and is stripped out in other builds. \n\nThe purpose of this class is to provide a way to track and debug GPU markers during rendering. It contains four methods: `clearGpuMarkers()`, `pushGpuMarker(device, name)`, `popGpuMarker(device)`, and `toString()`. \n\nThe `clearGpuMarkers()` method clears the internal stack of GPU markers. It should be called at the start of each frame to prevent the array from growing if there are exceptions during rendering. \n\nThe `pushGpuMarker(device, name)` method pushes a GPU marker to the stack on the device. It takes in a `GraphicsDevice` object and a `name` string as parameters. The `name` parameter represents the name of the marker being pushed to the stack. \n\nThe `popGpuMarker(device)` method pops a GPU marker from the stack on the device. It takes in a `GraphicsDevice` object as a parameter. If the `markers` array is not empty, the last element is removed from the array. Then, the `popMarker()` method is called on the `device` object. \n\nThe `toString()` method converts the current markers into a single string format. It returns a string representation of the current markers, with each marker separated by a `|` character. \n\nThis class can be used in the larger project to debug GPU markers during rendering. For example, a developer could use the `pushGpuMarker()` method to push a marker to the stack before rendering a specific object. Then, they could use the `popGpuMarker()` method to pop the marker from the stack after rendering the object. If there are any issues during rendering, the `toString()` method could be used to get a string representation of the current markers and help identify the issue. \n\nOverall, the `DebugGraphics` class provides a useful debugging tool for tracking GPU markers during rendering in the PlayCanvas engine.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and when does it execute?\n- This code is an internal graphics debug system for GPU markers and similar, and it only executes in the debug build.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `markers` array and when is it cleared?\n- The `markers` array represents a stack of GPU markers, and it is cleared at the start of each frame to prevent the array from growing if there are exceptions during rendering.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `toString` method and what does it return?\n- The `toString` method converts the current markers into a single string format, and it returns a string representation of the current markers joined by a pipe character."
