  "summary": "The code defines a class called `Shader` that represents a program responsible for rendering graphical primitives on a device's graphics processor. The shader is generated from a shader definition, which specifies the code for processing vertices and fragments processed by the GPU. The language of the code is GLSL (or more specifically ESSL, the OpenGL ES Shading Language). The shader definition also describes how the PlayCanvas engine should map vertex buffer elements onto the attributes specified in the vertex shader code.\n\nThe `Shader` class has a constructor that takes a `graphicsDevice` object and a `definition` object as parameters. The `definition` object contains the name of the shader, the mapping of vertex shader attribute names to semantics SEMANTIC_*, vertex shader source (GLSL code), fragment shader source (GLSL code), and other optional parameters. The constructor initializes the `id`, `device`, `definition`, and `name` properties of the `Shader` instance. It also preprocesses the shader sources using the `Preprocessor` class and initializes the `ready` and `failed` properties to `false`.\n\nThe `Shader` class has a `destroy` method that frees resources associated with the shader. It also has `loseContext` and `restoreContext` methods that are called when the WebGL context is lost or restored, respectively.\n\nThe `Shader` class is used in the PlayCanvas engine to create and manage shaders for rendering 3D graphics. Developers can create custom shaders by defining the vertex and fragment shader sources and specifying the mapping of vertex buffer elements to shader attributes. The `Shader` class provides a way to preprocess the shader sources and manage the lifecycle of the shader. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nconst shaderDefinition = {\n    attributes: {\n        aPosition: pc.SEMANTIC_POSITION\n    },\n    vshader: [\n        \"attribute vec3 aPosition;\",\n        \"\",\n        \"void main(void)\",\n        \"{\",\n        \"    gl_Position = vec4(aPosition, 1.0);\",\n        \"}\"\n    ].join(\"\\n\"),\n    fshader: [\n        \"precision \" + graphicsDevice.precision + \" float;\",\n        \"\",\n        \"void main(void)\",\n        \"{\",\n        \"    gl_FragColor = vec4(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);\",\n        \"}\"\n    ].join(\"\\n\")\n};\n\nconst shader = new pc.Shader(graphicsDevice, shaderDefinition);\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Shader` class?\n- The `Shader` class is responsible for rendering graphical primitives on a device's graphics processor. It is generated from a shader definition that specifies the code for processing vertices and fragments processed by the GPU.\n\n2. What parameters are required to create a new instance of the `Shader` class?\n- A new instance of the `Shader` class requires a `graphicsDevice` parameter used to manage the shader, and a `definition` object parameter that specifies the shader definition from which to build the shader. The `definition` object should include a `vshader` parameter for the vertex shader source (GLSL code) and an optional `fshader` parameter for the fragment shader source (GLSL code).\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `init()` method in the `Shader` class?\n- The `init()` method initializes a shader back to its default state by setting the `ready` and `failed` properties to `false`. This method is called internally by the `constructor` method."
