  "summary": "The code defines a class called `ScopeSpace` which represents a scope for variables. The purpose of this class is to create a new scope and manage variables within that scope. The class has a constructor that takes a `name` parameter and sets it as the name of the scope. It also creates a new `Map` object called `variables` which will be used to store the variables in the scope.\n\nThe `resolve` method is used to get or create a variable in the scope. It takes a `name` parameter which is the name of the variable. If the variable does not exist in the `variables` map, a new `ScopeId` object is created with the `name` parameter and added to the `variables` map. The `ScopeId` object is then returned. If the variable already exists in the `variables` map, the existing `ScopeId` object is returned.\n\nThe `removeValue` method is used to clear the value for any uniform with a matching value. It takes a `value` parameter which is the value to clear. This method is marked with `@ignore` which means it is not intended to be used outside of the class.\n\nThis class is likely used in the larger PlayCanvas engine project to manage variables in different scopes. For example, if there are multiple shaders in the project, each shader may have its own scope for variables. The `ScopeSpace` class can be used to create and manage these scopes. The `resolve` method can be used to get or create a variable in a specific scope, and the `removeValue` method can be used to clear the value for any uniform with a matching value. \n\nHere is an example of how the `ScopeSpace` class can be used:\n\n```\nimport { ScopeSpace } from 'playcanvas-engine';\n\n// create a new scope for variables\nconst shaderScope = new ScopeSpace('shader');\n\n// get or create a variable in the scope\nconst color = shaderScope.resolve('color');\n\n// set the value of the variable\ncolor.value = [1, 0, 0];\n\n// clear the value for any uniform with a matching value\nshaderScope.removeValue([1, 0, 0]);\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `ScopeId` import?\n   - The `ScopeId` import is used in the `ScopeSpace` class to create a new instance of `ScopeId` for each variable in the scope.\n\n2. What is the `resolve` method used for?\n   - The `resolve` method is used to get or create a variable in the scope and returns the corresponding `ScopeId` instance.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `removeValue` method?\n   - The `removeValue` method is used to clear the value for any uniform with a matching value, which is used to remove deleted textures."
