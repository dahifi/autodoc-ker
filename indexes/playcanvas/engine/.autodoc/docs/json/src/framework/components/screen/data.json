  "summary": "The code above defines a class called `ScreenComponentData` and exports it for use in other parts of the PlayCanvas engine project. The purpose of this class is to store data related to a screen component, which is a visual element that can be added to a game or application. \n\nThe `constructor` method initializes a property called `enabled` to `true`. This property determines whether the screen component is currently enabled or disabled. By default, all screen components are enabled when they are created. \n\nDevelopers can use this class to create and manage screen components in their projects. For example, they might create a new instance of `ScreenComponentData` for each screen component they add to their game or application. They can then set the `enabled` property to `false` to disable a screen component when it is not needed. \n\nHere is an example of how a developer might use this class in their code:\n\n```\nimport { ScreenComponentData } from 'playcanvas-engine';\n\n// Create a new screen component\nconst myScreenComponent = new ScreenComponentData();\n\n// Disable the screen component\nmyScreenComponent.enabled = false;\n```\n\nIn summary, the `ScreenComponentData` class provides a simple way for developers to store and manage data related to screen components in their projects. By using this class, they can easily enable or disable screen components as needed, which can help improve performance and reduce visual clutter in their games or applications.",
