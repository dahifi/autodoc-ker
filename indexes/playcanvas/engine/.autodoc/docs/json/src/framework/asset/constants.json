  "summary": "This file contains a set of constants and a regular expression that are used throughout the PlayCanvas engine project to define and validate various types of assets and URLs.\n\nThe `ABSOLUTE_URL` constant is a regular expression that matches absolute URLs, including protocol-relative URLs, data URLs, and blob URLs. This regular expression is used to validate URLs throughout the PlayCanvas engine, ensuring that only valid URLs are used to load assets and resources.\n\nThe remaining constants define the various types of assets that can be loaded and used in the PlayCanvas engine. These include animations, audio files, images, JSON data, models, materials, text files, textures, texture atlases, cubemaps, shaders, CSS files, HTML files, scripts, and containers. These constants are used throughout the PlayCanvas engine to identify and load the appropriate assets for a given scene or project.\n\nFor example, to load an image asset in PlayCanvas, you would use the `ASSET_IMAGE` constant to identify the asset type, like this:\n\n```\nconst asset = app.assets.find('my-image.png', ASSET_IMAGE);\n```\n\nOverall, this file provides a set of useful constants and regular expressions that are used throughout the PlayCanvas engine to ensure that assets and resources are loaded correctly and efficiently.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `ABSOLUTE_URL` regular expression?\n- The `ABSOLUTE_URL` regular expression is used to match absolute URLs, including data URLs and blob URLs.\n\n2. What are the different asset types defined in this code?\n- The code defines asset types for animation, audio, image, JSON, model, material, text, texture, texture atlas, cubemap, shader, CSS, HTML, script, and container.\n\n3. What is the format of the documentation comments for the asset type constants?\n- The documentation comments for the asset type constants use JSDoc format, with a `@type` tag followed by a string indicating the name of the asset type."
