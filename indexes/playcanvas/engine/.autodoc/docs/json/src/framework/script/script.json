  "summary": "The code defines functions that allow developers to create and register custom scripts for the PlayCanvas engine. The `createScript` function creates a new `ScriptType` class that is registered to the `ScriptRegistry` using a unique name. The `ScriptType` class is used to define custom logic using JavaScript that can be used to create interaction for entities. The function returns the class type (constructor function) that the developer can further extend by adding attributes and prototype methods. If there is an error, the function returns null.\n\nThe `registerScript` function registers an existing class type as a `ScriptType` to the `ScriptRegistry`. This is useful when defining an ES6 script class that extends `ScriptType`. The function takes an existing class type (constructor function) and registers it to the `ScriptRegistry` using a unique name. The function also adds the class to the `scripts` registry and pushes it to the `ScriptTypes` array.\n\nThe `getReservedScriptNames` function returns a set of reserved script names that cannot be used when creating a new script. These names include `system`, `entity`, `create`, `destroy`, `swap`, `move`, `data`, `scripts`, `_scripts`, `_scriptsIndex`, `_scriptsData`, `enabled`, `_oldState`, `onEnable`, `onDisable`, `onPostStateChange`, `_onSetEnabled`, `_checkState`, `_onBeforeRemove`, `_onInitializeAttributes`, `_onInitialize`, `_onPostInitialize`, `_onUpdate`, `_onPostUpdate`, `_callbacks`, `has`, `get`, `on`, `off`, `fire`, `once`, and `hasEvent`.\n\nThe `reservedAttributes` object is used by the editor and is deprecated. It is migrated to `ScriptAttributes.reservedNames` and should be deleted.\n\nThe code provides an example of how to use the `createScript` function to create a new script called `Turning`. The `attributes` object is used to define a `speed` attribute that is available in the Editor UI. The `update` function is defined to rotate the entity around the y-axis based on the `speed` attribute.\n\nOverall, these functions provide a way for developers to create and register custom scripts for the PlayCanvas engine. This allows for greater flexibility and customization of the engine to suit the needs of different projects.",

What is the purpose of the `createScript` function?\n   \n   The `createScript` function is used to create and register a new `ScriptType` class, which is used to define custom logic using JavaScript that is used to create interaction for entities.\n\n2. What is the difference between `createScript` and `registerScript` functions?\n   \n   The `createScript` function is used to create and register a new `ScriptType` class, while the `registerScript` function is used to register an existing class type as a `ScriptType` to the `ScriptRegistry`.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `reservedScriptNames` and `reservedAttributes` constants?\n   \n   The `reservedScriptNames` constant is a set of reserved names that cannot be used as script names, while the `reservedAttributes` constant is a mapping of reserved attribute names that are used in the Editor UI."
