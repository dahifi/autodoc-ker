  "summary": "This code defines several constants that are used in the PlayCanvas engine project to specify different types of {@link ElementComponent}s and fit modes for content within those elements. \n\nThe first three constants, `ELEMENTTYPE_GROUP`, `ELEMENTTYPE_IMAGE`, and `ELEMENTTYPE_TEXT`, define the different types of elements that can be used in the project. These types are used to specify the type of content that will be displayed within an element. For example, an `ELEMENTTYPE_IMAGE` element would be used to display an image, while an `ELEMENTTYPE_TEXT` element would be used to display text.\n\nThe next three constants, `FITMODE_STRETCH`, `FITMODE_CONTAIN`, and `FITMODE_COVER`, define different fit modes for content within an element. These fit modes are used to specify how the content should be scaled to fit within the element's bounding box. For example, `FITMODE_STRETCH` would stretch the content to fill the entire bounding box, while `FITMODE_CONTAIN` would scale the content to fit within the bounding box while preserving its aspect ratio.\n\nOverall, these constants are used throughout the PlayCanvas engine project to specify the type of content and how it should be displayed within an element. For example, when creating a new element, the developer would specify the type of element using one of the `ELEMENTTYPE` constants, and the fit mode for the content using one of the `FITMODE` constants. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```javascript\nimport { ELEMENTTYPE_IMAGE, FITMODE_COVER } from 'playcanvas-engine';\n\n// create a new image element with content that covers the entire bounding box\nconst imageElement = new ElementComponent(app, {\n  type: ELEMENTTYPE_IMAGE,\n  fitWidth: FITMODE_COVER,\n  fitHeight: FITMODE_COVER\n});\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines constants for different types of ElementComponents and fit modes used in the PlayCanvas engine.\n\n2. How are these constants used in the PlayCanvas engine?\n- These constants are likely used as parameters or options for various functions and methods within the PlayCanvas engine that deal with ElementComponents and their display properties.\n\n3. Are there any other types of ElementComponents or fit modes available in the PlayCanvas engine?\n- It's possible that there are other types of ElementComponents or fit modes available, but they are not defined in this particular code file. A smart developer might want to check other files in the PlayCanvas engine to see if there are additional constants or options available."
