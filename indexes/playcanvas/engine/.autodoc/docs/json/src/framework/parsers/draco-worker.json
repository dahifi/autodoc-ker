  "summary": "The `DracoWorker` function is a Web Worker that decodes Draco compressed meshes. It loads the Draco WebAssembly module and provides a `decodeMesh` function that accepts a `DataView` containing the compressed mesh data and returns an object containing the decoded mesh vertices and indices. The `decodeMesh` function uses the Draco decoder to decode the mesh data and generates normals if they are missing. The decoded mesh data is interleaved and packed into an `ArrayBuffer` that is returned as part of the result object.\n\nThe `DracoWorker` function uses the following constants and functions:\n\n- `POSITION_ATTRIBUTE` and `NORMAL_ATTRIBUTE` are constants that represent the attribute types for position and normal data.\n- `loadWasm` is a function that loads the Draco WebAssembly module and returns a promise that resolves to the module instance.\n- `wrap` is a function that wraps a typed array with a new typed array of a different data type.\n- `componentSizeInBytes` is a function that returns the size in bytes of a component of a given data type.\n- `attributeSizeInBytes` is a function that returns the size in bytes of an attribute.\n- `attributeOrder` is an object that maps attribute types to indices used for sorting attributes.\n- `generateNormals` is a function that generates normals for a mesh given its vertices and indices.\n- `decodeMesh` is a function that decodes a Draco compressed mesh and returns an object containing the decoded mesh vertices and indices.\n- `decode` is a function that decodes a mesh data object and posts a message containing the decoded mesh data back to the main thread.\n\nThe `DracoWorker` function exports the `DracoWorker` class, which can be used to create a new instance of the worker. The `DracoWorker` class provides a `decodeMesh` method that can be used to decode a compressed mesh. The `decodeMesh` method accepts a `DataView` containing the compressed mesh data and returns a promise that resolves to an object containing the decoded mesh vertices and indices. The `DracoWorker` class uses the `Worker` API to create a new Web Worker and communicate with it using messages.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a worker function called `DracoWorker` that can decode Draco-encoded meshes and generate normals for them.\n\n2. What external dependencies does this code have?\n- This code depends on the Draco library, which is loaded as a WebAssembly module and a JavaScript file.\n\n3. What is the format of the data that this code can decode?\n- This code can decode data that represents a triangular mesh in the Draco format."
