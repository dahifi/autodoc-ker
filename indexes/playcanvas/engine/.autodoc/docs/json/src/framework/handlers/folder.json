  "summary": "The `FolderHandler` class is a resource handler for folders in the PlayCanvas engine project. It has two methods: `load` and `open`.\n\nThe `load` method takes in a URL and a callback function. It does not perform any actual loading of data, but simply calls the callback function with `null` values for both parameters. This is because folders do not contain any data that needs to be loaded, but rather serve as containers for other resources.\n\nThe `open` method takes in a URL and data. It simply returns the data that was passed in. This method is used to retrieve the contents of a folder and return it to the caller.\n\nThe `handlerType` property is a string that specifies the type of resource that this handler is responsible for. In this case, it is set to \"folder\".\n\nThis class can be used in the larger PlayCanvas engine project to handle the loading and opening of folders. For example, if a user wants to load the contents of a folder, they can use this class to do so. Here is an example of how this class might be used:\n\n```\nimport { FolderHandler } from 'path/to/FolderHandler.js';\n\nconst folderUrl = 'path/to/folder';\nconst folderHandler = new FolderHandler();\n\nfolderHandler.load(folderUrl, (err, data) => {\n  if (err) {\n    console.error(`Error loading folder: ${err}`);\n  } else {\n    const folderContents = folderHandler.open(folderUrl, data);\n    console.log(`Folder contents: ${folderContents}`);\n  }\n});\n```\n\nIn this example, we import the `FolderHandler` class and create a new instance of it. We then specify the URL of the folder we want to load and call the `load` method with a callback function. If there are no errors, we call the `open` method with the same URL and the data that was returned from the `load` method. This will give us the contents of the folder, which we can then use as needed.",
  "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of the `FolderHandler` class?** \nThe `FolderHandler` class is a resource handler that handles folders.\n\n2. **What does the `load` method do?** \nThe `load` method takes a URL and a callback function as parameters and calls the callback with `null` values for both parameters.\n\n3. **What does the `open` method do?** \nThe `open` method takes a URL and data as parameters and returns the data."
